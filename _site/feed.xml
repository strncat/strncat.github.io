<br />
Basically, given two triangles where two of the sides are equal and the angles contained between the two sides in each triangle are also equal, then the two triangles are equal in every other respect meaning that the third side is also equal and the remaining two angles are equal as well.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof.</b><br />
Let the triangles be $ABC$ and $DEF$. Let the two sides be arbitrarily chosen. Suppose we have $AB = DE$ and $BC = EF$ and the angle $ABC = DEF$ (hypothesis).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr4/1.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Now, place the vertex $A$ onto the vertex $D$. First, because the angles are equal, the line $AB$ will fall onto the line $DE$ (same direction) and second, because we know that $AB = DE$, then the vertex $B$ must coincide with the vertex $E$. Similarly, the vertex $C$ must coincide with the vertex $F$. 
<br /><br />
Since the vertices $B$ and $E$ coincide with each other and the vertices $C$ and $F$ coincide with each other, then the side $BC = EF$. If that’s not the case, then the straight lines connecting $E$ and $F$ and $B$ and $C$ will include a space but axiom 10 states that two straight lines cannot include a space. In other words, there is only one straight line between two points and therefore $BC = EF$.
<br /><br />
So now that we have all vertices coinciding with each other and all three sides coinciding with each other we can conclude that the two triangles coincide with each other and so they are equal in all respects due to axiom 8 (magnitudes which coincide with one another or exactly fill the same space, are equal). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Thoughts:</b>
<br />
(1) When we placed $A$ onto $D$, we concluded two things. First, because the angles are equal, the line $AB$ will fall onto the line $DE$. Second, because it’s given than $AB = DE$, then $A$ must coincide with $D$. I hard to wrap my head around this for a little longer.
<br /><br />
(2) Instead of proving that the third side must be equal to the same third side of the second triangle, I think we could just conclude that the triangles are equal just from having the three vertices coinciding. This is because between any two points, we can only have one straight line (axiom 10) and so the two triangles must coincide and be equal to each other without having to prove the third side seperately. (I think?)
<br /><br />
Overall, this was a confusing proposition. What does placing a vertex on top another vertex even mean? I guess perhaps we could use proposition 2 to re-create the second triangle on top of the first triangle?

<p>From wikipedia, “One radian is defined as the angle subtended from the center of a circle which intercepts an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle”. Some additional facts:</p>
<ul>
<li> The ratio of the circumference ($c$) to the diameter ($d$) of the circle (any circle) is the constant $\pi$. </li>
	<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\pi = \frac{c}{d} = \frac{c}{2r}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
    </div>

<li> This means that the circumference is given by, </li>
	\begin{align}
	c = 2\pi r.
	\end{align}

<li> Since the circumference is $2\pi r$, then there are $2\pi r / r = 2\pi$ such arcs of length $r$ in any circle each. This is about 6.28 arcs! (see below)</li>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/arcs.png" width="55%" class="center" /></p>
	


<li> So, we have $2\pi$ arcs of length $r$ that cover the whole circle. Each of their angles is measured at 1 radian. This means that to go a whole rotation around the entire circle we need $2\pi * 1 = 2\pi$ radians. </li>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/2pi.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>



<li> So, a 360 degrees measure is equal to $2\pi$ radians or in other words, 1 radian is equal to 57.2958 degrees and that's where the conversion formula between degrees and radians come from. </li>

In other words, given a point $A$ and another finite straight line $CB$, draw a line equal to $CB$ at $A$.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<b>Proof.</b><br />
Let the given point be $A$ and the given finite line be $CB$.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr2/1.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Use postule 1 to draw a line between $A$ and one of the end points say $B$.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr2/2.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Next, use <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/23/euclid-pr1.html">proposition 1</a> to draw an equilateral triangle from the drawn line $AB$.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr2/3.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Next, describe a circle with center $B$ and radius $CB$ using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/22/euclid-book1-postulates.html">postulate 3</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr2/5.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Extend the line DB all the way till intersects the circle at $E$ using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/22/euclid-book1-postulates.html">postulate 2</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr2/6.png" width="45%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Now describe another circle with center $D$ and radius $DE$ (postulate 3).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr2/7.png" width="55%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Extend the line DA until it intersects the circle at $F$.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr2/8.png" width="55%" class="center" /></p>
<p>The claim is that $AF = BC$ which is what we want. To see this, we know that $DF=DE$ by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/26/euclid-book1-definitions.html">definition 15</a>. We know that $DA = DB$ by construction.

<h4><b>Mesh Representation</b></h4>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/curves/00-line.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<p>We can represent meshes using different ways. One way to represent a mesh is to simply store the triangles the mesh is made up. Another representation is storing the list of vertices and then the list of indexed triangles so for example</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
Vertices: \\
0: x_0, y_0, z_0 \\
1: x_1, y_1, z_1 \\
Triangles: \\
0, 1, 2, \\
0, 1, 3
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Note here that we can have the same set of vertices represent two different mesh topologies. so take this square for example. We can represent it with the two triangles or the other two triangles.</p>

<h4><b>Mesh Representation</b></h4>
<p>2D manifolds are surfaces such that when cut with a small sphere, it will always yields a disk or half a disk on the boundary. Manfolds have some important properties like</p>
<ul>
  <li>an edge connects two faces exactly.</li>
  <li>an edge connects two vertices only.</li>
  <li>a face consists of a ring edges and vertices.</li>
  <li>….</li>

<h4><b>Bezier Curves</b></h4>
<p>From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds"> The Continuity of Splines</a>, I learned that starting with two points $p_0$ and $p_1$ we can create a path between them by linearly interpolating between the two points using</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/curves/00-line.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
P(t) = (1-t)P_0 + tP_1
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>where $t$ is a value between 0 and 1. So for $t=0$, we get $P_0$ and for $t=1$, we get $P_1$. For any other $t$ value, we get a point on the line between the two end points. So now that we have this, we can add a second point and also interpolate between the second and third point using the same $t$ in</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/curves/01-secondline.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
P'(t) = (1-t)P_1 + tP_2
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>And now interpolate between the brand new two points $(1-t)P_0 + tP_1$ and (1-t)P_1 + tP_2.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/curves/01-secondline.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
P(t) &amp;= (1-t)((1-t)P_0 + tP_1) + t((1-t)P_1 + tP_2) \\
&amp;= (1-t)^2P_0 + 2(1-t)tP_1 + t^2P_2
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This is called a quadractic Bezier curve and it generates a nice smooth curve!
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Cubic Bezier Curve</b></h4>
<p>We don’t have to stop at the quadratic Bezier curve. Let’s add a third point and again interpolate between the second and third point</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/curves/01-secondline.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<p>and let’s connect all the new points</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/curves/01-secondline.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<p>and again connect the last two points</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/curves/01-secondline.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<p>The curve generated is a smooth curve and called the cubic Bezier curve! Combining and labeling everything. We have:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a &amp;= (1-t)P_0 + tP_1 \\
b &amp;= (1-t)P_1 + tP_2 \\
c &amp;= (1-t)P_2 + tP_3 \\
d &amp;= (1-t)a + tb \\
e &amp;= (1-t)b + tc \\
P(t) &amp;= (1-t)d + te
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This is known as the DeCasteljau algorithm. There is another form of these points written a weighted sum of the control points themselves,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
P &amp;= P_0(-t^3 + 3t^2 - 3t + 1) \\
 &amp;+  P_1(3t^3 - 6t^2 + 3t)  \\
 &amp;+  P_2(-3t^3 + 3t^2) \\
 &amp;+  P_3(t^3)

<p>This is the Bernstein form of the Bezier curve. This form is so interesting in that at the beginning when $t=0$, It’s just $P_0$ as you move along the weights will get adjusted but they will all add up to 1 at any point until you reach the end when $t=1$ and we’re at 100% of $P_3$. This weighted sum is also called a convex combination.

But there is yet another form which re-arranges the points around the $t$ coefficients</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
P &amp;= P_0 \\
 &amp;+  t(-3P_0 + 3P_1)  \\
 &amp;+  t^2 (3P_0 - 6P_1 + 3P_2) \\
 &amp;+  t^3 (-P_0 + 3P_1 - 3P_2 + P_3)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>And finally, the forth form which is the matrix form.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
P &amp;= [1 t t^2 t^3][ 1 0 0 0]
                  [-3 3 0 0]
				  [3 -6 3 0]

<h4><b>Bezier Curves of Higher Degrees</b></h4>
<p>We can keep adding more and more control points to form the curve that we want but as we add more points, it gets more expensive to calculate and also harder to manipulate as moving a single control point affects the entire curve. For this reason, instead of adding more degrees, we instead connect these bezier curves together to form a Bezier Spline!

So for $t=0$, we get $P_0$ and for $t=1$, we get $P_1$. For any other $t$ value, we get a point on the line between the two end points. So now that we have this, we can add a second point and also interpolate between the second and third point using the same $t$ in $$ \begin{align*} P'(t) = (1-t)P_1 + tP_2 \end{align*} $$ And now interpolate between the brand new two points $(1-t)P_0 + tP_1$ and (1-t)P_1 + tP_2. $$ \begin{align*} P(t) &amp;= (1-t)((1-t)P_0 + tP_1) + t((1-t)P_1 + tP_2) \\ &amp;= (1-t)^2P_0 + 2(1-t)tP_1 + t^2P_2 \end{align*} $$ This is called a quadractic Bezier curve and it generates a nice smooth curve! Cubic Bezier Curve We don’t have to stop at the quadratic Bezier curve. Let’s add a third point and again interpolate between the second and third point and let’s connect all the new points and again connect the last two points The curve generated is a smooth curve and called the cubic Bezier curve! Combining and labeling everything. We have: $$ \begin{align*} a &amp;= (1-t)P_0 + tP_1 \\ b &amp;= (1-t)P_1 + tP_2 \\ c &amp;= (1-t)P_2 + tP_3 \\ d &amp;= (1-t)a + tb \\ e &amp;= (1-t)b + tc \\ P(t) &amp;= (1-t)d + te \end{align*} $$ This is known as the DeCasteljau algorithm. There is another form of these points written a weighted sum of the control points themselves, $$ \begin{align*} P &amp;= P_0(-t^3 + 3t^2 - 3t + 1) \\ &amp;+ P_1(3t^3 - 6t^2 + 3t) \\ &amp;+ P_2(-3t^3 + 3t^2) \\ &amp;+ P_3(t^3) \end{align*} $$ This is the Bernstein form of the Bezier curve. This form is so interesting in that at the beginning when $t=0$, It’s just $P_0$ as you move along the weights will get adjusted but they will all add up to 1 at any point until you reach the end when $t=1$ and we’re at 100% of $P_3$. This weighted sum is also called a convex combination. But there is yet another form which re-arranges the points around the $t$ coefficients $$ \begin{align*} P &amp;= P_0 \\ &amp;+ t(-3P_0 + 3P_1) \\ &amp;+ t^2 (3P_0 - 6P_1 + 3P_2) \\ &amp;+ t^3 (-P_0 + 3P_1 - 3P_2 + P_3) \end{align*} $$ And finally, the forth form which is the matrix form. $$ \begin{align*} P &amp;= [1 t t^2 t^3][ 1 0 0 0] [-3 3 0 0] [3 -6 3 0] [-1 3 -3 1] [p_0 p_1 p_2 p_3] \end{align*} $$ Bezier Curves of Higher Degrees We can keep adding more and more control points to form the curve that we want but as we add more points, it gets more expensive to calculate and also harder to manipulate as moving a single control point affects the entire curve.
