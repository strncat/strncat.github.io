  1.33 definition: subspace
</div>
<div class="ybdiv">
  A subset \(U\) of \(V\) is called a <i>subspace</i> of \(V\) if \(U\) is also a vector space with the same additive identity, addition and scalar multiplication as on \(V\).
</div>
<p><br />
Next are the conditions that we must verify to prove that a subset is a subspace.
<br /></p>
<div class="bdiv">
  1.34 conditions for a subspace
</div>
<div class="bbdiv">
  A subset \(U\) of \(V\) is a subspace of \(V\) if and only if \(U\) satisfies the following three conditions.<br />
  <b>additive identity</b><br />
  \(0 \in U\).<br />
  <b>closed under addition</b><br />
  \(u, w \in U implies u + w \in U\).
  <b>closed under multiplication</b><br />
  \(a \in \mathbf{F} and u \in U implies au \in U\).
</div>
<p><br />
This is something that also threw me off. The example in the book defines \(S\) as the interval \([0,1]\) and \(F = R\) and so \(R^{[0,1]}\) is the set of all functions from \([0,1]\) to \(R\) or in other words, the set of real-valued functions on \([0,1]\).
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>The Vector Space \(\mathbf{F}^S\)</b></h4>
<p>\(\mathbf{F}^S\) is another example of a vector space over \(\mathbf{F}\) along with the operations of addition and scalar multiplication defined previously above. Moreever, let the function 0 defined as \(0(x) = 0\) be the additive identity for all \(x \in S\). For the additive inverse, let \(-f: S \rightarrow \mathbf{F}\) be defined as \((-f)(x) = -f(x)\) be the additive inverse of \(f\) for all \(x \in S\).
<br />
<br />
What’s more interesting is to know that \(F^{n}\) (which is what we usually see) is a special case of the vector space \(\mathbf{F}^S\). [Why? TODO. I didn’t get the explanation in the book]
<br />

<h4>Additional Vector Space Results</h4>
<div class="bdiv">
  1.26 unique additive identity
</div>
<div class="bbdiv">
  A vector space has a unique additive identity.
</div>
<p><br />
<b>Proof:</b>
Suppose \(V\) is a vector space. Now suppose for the sake of contradiction that 0 and 0’ are additive inverses of \(V\) where \(0 \neq 0'\). This means that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
0' = 0' + 0 = 0 + 0' = 0.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>The first equality holds because 0 is an additive identity. The second equality comes from the fact that addition must be commutative and lastly the last equality holds because 0’ is an additive identity. Therefore, \(0 = 0'\) which is a contradiction and the additive identity must be unique. \(\blacksquare\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<div class="bdiv">
  1.27 unique additive inverse
</div>
<div class="bbdiv">
  Every element in a vector space has a unique additive inverse.
</div>
<p><br />
<b>Proof:</b> 
Suppose \(V\) is a vector space. Let \(v \in V\). Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(v\) has two additive inverses \(w\) and \(w'\) such that \(w \neq w'\). Then</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
w = w + 0 = w + (v + w') = (w + v) + w' = 0 + w' = w'.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>The first equality holds because 0 is the additive identity. The second equality holds because \(v + w' = 0\) since \(w'\) is an additive inverse. The third equality holds because addition is associative and finally \(w + v =\) since \(w\) is also an additive inverse. Since \(w = w'\), we can conclude that \(V\) must have a unique additive inverse. \(\blacksquare\)
<br />
