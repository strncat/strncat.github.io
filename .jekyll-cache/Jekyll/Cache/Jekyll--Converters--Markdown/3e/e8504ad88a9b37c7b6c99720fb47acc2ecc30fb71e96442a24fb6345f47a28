I"Ù<p>Suppose we have two line segments $\overline{ab}$ and $\overline{cd}$. How can we determine their intersection? We previously developed a method to determine the existence of the intersection without having to compute the actual intersection point. We did this using the orientation test by basically testing if $c$ and $d$ are on opposite sides of the line that goes through  $\overline{ab}$ and then again if $a$ and $b$ are on opposite sides of the line that goes through $\overline{cd}$. This was neat and we avoided having to deal with floating point values. But what if we wanted to find the actual intersection point, if any?

<h4><b>Parametric Representation</b></h4>
<p>Let $\Vec{A} = b - a$ and let $\Vec{B} = d - c$. A point on the line that goes through $\overline{ab}$ can be represented using</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    p(s) = a + sA.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
