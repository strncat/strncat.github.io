<br /></p>
<hr />

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof.</b><br /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr8/0.png" width="65%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Let the triangles be $ABC$ and $DEF$ respectively. Let $AB = DE$, $AC = DF$ and the bases $BC = EF$. We will prove that the angle $\angle BAC$ equals the angle $\angle EDF$. 
<br />
<br />
Using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/23/euclid-book1-pr2.html">proposition 2</a>, copy the triangle $DEF$ to where the triangle $ABC$ is, by placing the vertex $B$ onto the vertex $E$ and the straight line $BC$ on top of the straight line $EF$. The point $C$ must coincide with the point $F$ since we have $BC = EF$ by our hypothesis.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr8/1.png" width="45%" class="center" /></p>

<p>We claim that $AB$ must coincide with $DE$ and $AC$ must coincide with $DF$. To see this, recall that $AB = DE$ and $AC = DF$ by our hypothesis. Since we have the same base and the lines are equal, then we can use <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/30/euclid-book1-pr7.html">proposition 7</a> to conclude that the lines $DE$ and $DF$ must meet where the lines $AB$ and $AC$ meet which is point $A$. Therefore, we see that point $D$ must coincide with point $A$. Therefore, we see that all points coincide with each other and therefore the triangles are equal (really?). Consequently, all angles are equal to each other.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Thoughts:</b> This was messy similar to proposition 4. <br />
(1) Even though the point $D$ coincided with point $A$. Why is it necessary for the line $AB$ to coincide with line $DE$? This feels like it needs axiom 10 from Byrne’s book which states that only one straight line can be drawn between two points. right?
<br />
<br />
(2) If the three points coincide with the other three points, why must the triangles be equal? this feels again like it needs axiom 10.

<br />
In other words, given some finite line $BC$. If we draw two straight lines from each end point to meet at a point $A$, then it is not possible to draw another set of straight lines equal to the first set and then have them meet at a different point that $A$. 
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof.</b><br /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr7/0.png" width="45%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Let the straight lines be $AB$ and $AC$ above drawn from the end points of the line $BC$. Suppose that it is possible to draw another set of lines equal to $AB$ and $AC$ and then have the new lines meet at a new point. Let the new point be $D$ and draw $DB$ such that it is equal to $AB$ and draw $DC$ such that it is equal to $AC$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr7/1.png" width="55%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/20/euclid-book1-postulates.html">postulate 1</a>, draw a line between points $A$ and $D$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr7/2.png" width="55%" class="center" /></p>

<p>In the triangles $ABD$, $AB = DB$ by construction. So $ABD$ is an isosceles triangle and the angles at the base are equal (<a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/23/euclid-book1-pr2.html">proposition 5</a>). Let this angle be $\alpha$. So $\angle DAB = \angle ADB = \alpha$. Similarly, the triangle $ACD$ is also an isosceles triangle by construction and the angles $\angle DAC$ and $\angle ADC$ are equal. Let this angle be $\beta$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr7/3.png" width="75%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Putting the triangles back together, we know that the angle $\angle BAD$ is the sum of angles $\angle BAC$ and $\angle CAD$. By <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/21/euclid-book1-common-notions.html">common notion 5</a> (The whole is greater than the part.), $\angle BAD &gt; \angle CAD$. But $\angle BAD = \alpha$ and $\angle CAD = \beta$ so $\alpha &gt; \beta$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr7/4.png" width="55%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Similarly, the angle $\angle ADC$ is the sum of angles $\angle ADB$ and $\angle BDC$. By common notion 5, $\angle ADC$ must be greater than $\angle ADB$. Therefore, $\beta &gt; \alpha$ which is a contradiction since we said earlier that $\alpha &gt; \beta$. Therefore, there can not exist two straight lines that are equal to $AB$ and $AC$ respectively that meet at a different point than point $A$.</p>

<br /></p>
<hr />

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof.</b><br /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr6/0.png" width="45%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Let the triangle be $ABC$. Choose two angles to be equal. Suppose we let $\angle B = \angle C$. We will prove that $AB = AC$. Suppose they are not. This means that one of them is greater than the other. Choose one arbitrarily to be the greater one. Suppose it is $AB$. Use <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/24/euclid-book1-pr3.html">proposition 3</a> to cut a line from $AB$ equal to $AC$. Let the cut line be $DB$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr6/1.png" width="45%" class="center" /></p>

<p>In the triangles $ABC$ and $DBC$, first $DB = AC$ by construction. Second, $BC$ is a common base. Third, $\angle DBC$ is a common angle. From this we can conclude that the triangles are equal in all respects by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/25/euclid-book1-pr4.html">proposition 4</a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr6/2.png" width="75%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Consequently, w$\angle ACB = \angle DCB$ let this angle be $\alpha$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr6/3.png" width="75%" class="center" /></p>

<p>But angle $\angle ACB$ equals to the sum of angles $\angle ACD$ and $\angle DCB$. Since $\angle ACB = \angle DCB = \alpha$, this implies that $\angle ACD$ must be 0, but this is impossible because this means that the vertices $A$ and $D$ are the same and we assumed that $AB$ is greater. So $AB$ must be equal to $AC$.</p>

<p>We’re interested in the 5th part since we want $\frac{5\pi}{6}$. The point corresponding to the angle $\frac{5\pi}{6}$ has the same y-coordinate of the point corresponding to $\frac{\pi}{6}$. It also has the same magnitude of the x-coordinate but the sign is negative.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/unit-circle-point-1.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>

<p>The coordinates of the point at angle $\frac{\pi}{6}$ are $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ and so the coordinates of the point at $\frac{5\pi}{6}$ will be $(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$.</p>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Construction.</b><br />
Let $ABC$ be a triangle with two equal sides. Let the equal sides be $AB$ and $AC$. This triangle can be easily constructed by drawing a point and then describing a circle with the center at the given point and a radius of a given length using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/20/euclid-book1-postulates.html">postulate 3</a>. We can then draw two lines from the center to the edge of the circle. These lines are equal by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/19/euclid-book1-definitions.html">definition 15</a>. Furthermore we can draw a third line connecting the two intersection points to form an isosceles triangle using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/20/euclid-book1-postulates.html">postulate 1</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/0.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/20/euclid-book1-postulates.html">postulate 2</a>, we can extend the lines $AB$ and $AC$ further down. The claim is that the orange and yellow angles below must be equal.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/1.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Define some point arbitrarily chosen along the extended line that we drew from point $B$. Let this point be $E$. Using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/23/euclid-book1-pr2.html">proposition 2</a>, we can define point $D$ on the other side such that $BE = CD$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/2.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/20/euclid-book1-postulates.html">postulate 1</a>, connect the lines between the points $C$ and $E$ and then again between the points $B$ and $D$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/3.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>

<p><b>Proof.</b><br />
In the shaded triangles $AEC$ and $ADB$, first, the triangles share an angle $A$. Second, $AC = AB$ by construction. Third, $AE = AD$. This is because $AB = AC$ and $BE = CD$ (both by construction). Therefore $AB + BE = AC + CD$ and so $AE = AD$ by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/21/euclid-book1-common-notions.html">common notion 2</a> (if equals are added to equal parts, then the wholes are equal). Since we have one angle and the two sides connecting it all equal then we can conclude that by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/25/euclid-book1-pr4.html">proposition 4</a>, the triangles are equal.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/4.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Consequently, the highlighted angles below are equal. Namely $\angle ACE = \angle ABD = \alpha$ and $\angle AEC = \angle ADB$. Furthermore, the blue lines are also equal, namely $BD = CE$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/5.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Next, consider the triangles $BEC$ and $BCD$ below. We claim that the triangles are also equal. To see this, we know that angles $\angle AEC = \angle ADB$ are equal (previously proven above). We also know that the sides $BD$ and $CE$ are also equal. lastly, $CD = $BE$ by construction. Therefore, these triangles are also equal in all respects by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/25References/euclid-book1-pr4.html">proposition 4</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/6.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Consequently, the highlighted angles will be equal, $\angle BCE = \angle CBD = \beta$ and $\angle EBC = \angle BCD = \gamma$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/7.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>So far we’ve proven $\angle ACE = \angle ABD = \alpha$ and $\angle BCE = \angle CBD = \beta$.  Therefore, the internal angles $ACB$ and $ABD$ are equal due to <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/21/euclid-book1-common-notions.html">common notion 3</a> (If equals be taken away from equals the remainders will be equal). Furthermore, we also proved that $\angle EBC = \angle BCD = \gamma$. Therefore the external angles are also equal by using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/21/euclid-book1-common-notions.html">common notion 2</a> (If equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal).</p>

Furthermore we can draw a third line connecting the two intersection points to form an isosceles triangle using postulate 1.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Euclid’s Elements Book 1: Definitions</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/03/26/euclid-book1-byrne-definitions-copy.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Euclid’s Elements Book 1: Definitions" /><published>2024-03-26T07:01:36-07:00</published><updated>2024-03-26T07:01:36-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/03/26/euclid-book1-byrne-definitions%20copy</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/03/26/euclid-book1-byrne-definitions-copy.html"><![CDATA[<p><b>1</b>: A point is that which has no parts.

<h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/radians/0.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>The radian measure of an angle is the ratio of the arc length to the radius of the circle.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\theta = \frac{\text{arc}}{r} = \frac{s}{r}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/radians/1.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>For a unit circle, The radian measure of an angle would be just the corresponding arc length. This is because the unit circle’s radius is defined to be 1.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>One Radian</b></h4>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/radians/2.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>The ratio $\frac{arc length}{radius}$ is 1 when both the arc length and the radius of the circle are equal and this is true for any circle of any size. So one radian is typically defined as the measure of the angle subtended from the center of a circle where the arc length is equal to the radius. 
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>How many radians in one revolution around the circle?</b></h4>
<p>The ratio of the circumference ($c$) to the diameter ($d$) of the circle (any circle) is the constant $\pi$.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi = \frac{c}{d} = \frac{c}{2r}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>

<p>This means that the circumference is given by, 
	\begin{align}
	c = 2\pi r.
	\end{align}</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/radians/3.png" width="55%" class="center" /></p>
<p>How many arc lengths of length $r$ are there in the circumference?</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{c}{r} = \frac{2\pi r}{r} = 2\pi.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>

<p>We have $2\pi$ arcs of length $r$. $2\pi$ is about 6.28. So approximately we have 6.28 arcs of length $r$ that cover the entire circumference of the circle. each of these arcs correspond to angle measured at 1 radian exactly (because $r/r = 1$). This means that to go a whole rotation around the entire circle we need $2\pi * 1 = 2\pi$ radians!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/radians/4.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h4><b>Radians and Degrees</b></h4>
<p>What is the relationship between degrees and radians? We know a whole rotation around the circle is exactly 360 degrees. Therefore 360 is equivalent to $2\pi$ or in other words, 1 radian is equal to 57.2958 degrees and that’s where the conversion formula between degrees and radians come from!</p>

Axiom 10 doesn’t seem to exist in the original book
<br />
<br />
<b>Proposition 4</b>: Proposition 4: “IF two triangles have two sides of the one respectively equal to two sides of the other, and the angles contained by those equal sides also equal; then their bases or their sides  are also equal: and the remaining and their remaining angles opposite to equal sides are respectively equal: and the triangles are equal in every respect.”
<br />
Basically, given two triangles where two of the sides are equal and the angles contained between the two sides in each triangle are also equal, then the two triangles are equal in every other respect meaning that the third side is also equal and the remaining two angles are equal as well.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof.</b><br />
Let the triangles be $ABC$ and $DEF$. Let the two sides be arbitrarily chosen. Suppose we have $AB = DE$ and $BC = EF$ and the angle $ABC = DEF$ (hypothesis).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr4/1.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Now, place the vertex $A$ onto the vertex $D$. First, because the angles are equal, the line $AB$ will fall onto the line $DE$ (same direction) and second, because we know that $AB = DE$, then the vertex $B$ must coincide with the vertex $E$. Similarly, the vertex $C$ must coincide with the vertex $F$. 
<br /><br />
Since the vertices $B$ and $E$ coincide with each other and the vertices $C$ and $F$ coincide with each other, then the side $BC = EF$. If that’s not the case, then the straight lines connecting $E$ and $F$ and $B$ and $C$ will include a space but axiom 10 states that two straight lines cannot include a space. In other words, there is only one straight line between two points and therefore $BC = EF$.
<br /><br />
So now that we have all vertices coinciding with each other and all three sides coinciding with each other we can conclude that the two triangles coincide with each other and so they are equal in all respects due to axiom 8 (magnitudes which coincide with one another or exactly fill the same space, are equal). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Thoughts:</b>
<br />
(1) When we placed $A$ onto $D$, we concluded two things. First, because the angles are equal, the line $AB$ will fall onto the line $DE$. Second, because it’s given than $AB = DE$, then $A$ must coincide with $D$. I hard to wrap my head around this for a little longer.
<br /><br />
(2) Instead of proving that the third side must be equal to the same third side of the second triangle, I think we could just conclude that the triangles are equal just from having the three vertices coinciding. This is because between any two points, we can only have one straight line (axiom 10) and so the two triangles must coincide and be equal to each other without having to prove the third side separately. (I think?)
<br /><br />
Overall, this was a confusing proposition. What does placing a vertex on top another vertex even mean? I guess perhaps we could use proposition 2 to re-create the second triangle on top of the first triangle?

The twelfth axiom may be expressed in any of the following ways: Two diverging straight lines cannot be both parallel to the same straight line. If a straight line intersect one of the two parallel straight lines it must also intersect the other. Only one straight line can be drawn through a given point, parallel to a given straight line.

Let $AB$ be the greater one and $CD$ the smaller one. Cut from $AB$ a line equal to $CD$.
<br /></p>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof.</b><br />
Let the greater line be $AB$ and the smaller line be $CD$.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr3/1.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Use <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/23/euclid-book1-pr2.html">proposition 2</a> to describe a line starting at $A$ that is equal in length to line $CD$.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr3/2.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Now, describe a circle with center at point $A$ and radius of length $AE$ using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/20/euclid-book1-postulates.html">postulate 3</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr3/3.png" width="45%" class="center" /></p>
<p>The claim is that $AF$ is equal to $CD$. To see this, we know that $EA = AF$ by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/19/euclid-book1-definitions.html">definition 15</a>. We also know that $EA = CD$ by construction. Therefore $AF = CD$ by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/21/euclid-book1-common-notions.html">axiom 1</a> (Magnitudes which are equal to the same are equal to each other).

<b>Thoughts:</b> I guess we wanted to prove that we can cut up a line such that a portion of that line is equal to a given line. I’m very early in the book and not sure where I see this is going.
