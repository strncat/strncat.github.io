If $n \in N, then 1 + (-1)^n(2n-1) is a multiple of 4$.

<b>Prime</b><br />
An Integer \(n &gt; 1\) is prime if the only positive divisors of \(n\) are \(1\) and \(n\). If \(n\) is not prime then \(n\) is composite.
<br /></p>

<b>Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:</b><br /> 
Every integer greater than 1 can be represented in exactly one way apart from rearrangement as a product of one or more primes.

<b>Greatest Common Divisor</b><br />
Let \(a, b \in Z\). Let</p>
<div center="">
$$
\begin{align*}
gcd(a,b) = \max \{ d \in Z : d \ |\  a \ \text{ and } \ d \ | \ b \}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>\(d\) is the greatest common divisor of both \(a\) and \(b\).

<b>Properties of the Greatest Common Divisor</b><br />
Let \(a, b \in Z\), we have</p>
<div center="">
$$
\begin{align*}
gcd(a,b) = gcd(a,b-a) = gcd(a,b+a)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Proof: Let \(gcd(a,b) = d \in Z\). By the defintion of \(gcd\) we know that \(d \ | \ a\) and \(d \ | \ b\). Therefore, for some \(x, y \in Z\), we have \(a = xd\) and, \(b = yd\). From this we have, \(a - b = d(x - y)\). Therefore, we know that \(d = gcd(a,b) \ | \ a - b\).</p>
