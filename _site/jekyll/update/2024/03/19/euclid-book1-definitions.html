    <p><b>1</b>: A point is that which has no parts.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>2</b>: A line is length without breadth.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>3</b>: The extremities of a line are points.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>4</b>: A straight or right line is that which lies evenly between its extremities.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>5</b>: A surface is that which has length and breadth only.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>6</b>: The extremities of a surface are lines.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>7</b>: A plane surface is that which lies evenly between its extremities.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>8</b>: A plane angle is the inclination of two lines to one another, in a plane, which meet together, but are not in the same direction.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>9</b>: A plane rectilinear angle is the inclination of two straight lines to one another, which meet together, but are not in the same straight line.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>10</b>: When a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, and the straight line standing on the other is called a perpendicular to that on which it stands.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>11</b>: An obtuse angle is an angle greater than a right angle.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>12</b>: An acute angle is less than a right angle.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>13</b>: A boundary is that which is an extremity of anything.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>14</b>: A figure is that which is contained by any boundary of boundaries.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>15</b>: A circle is a plane figure contained by one line such that all the straight lines falling from one point among those lying within the figure are equal to one another.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>16</b>: This point (from which the equal lines are drawn) is called the centre of the circle.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>17</b>: A diameter of a circle is a straight line drawn through the centre, terminated both ways in the circumference.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>18</b>: A semicircle is the figure contained by the diameter, and the part of the circle cut off by the diameter.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>19</b>: Rectilineal figures are those which are contained by straight lines: trilateral figures (triangles) being those contained by three; quadrilateral, those contained by four; and multilateral, those contained by more than four straight lines.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>20</b>: Of trilateral figures, an equilateral triangle is that which has its three sides equal, an isosceles triangle, that which has two of its sides equal, and a scalene triangle, that which has its three sides unequal.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>21</b>: Further, of trilateral figures, a right-angled triangle is that which has a right angle, and obtuse-angled triangle is that which has an obtuse angle, and an acute-angled triangle is that which has its three angles acute.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>22</b>: Of quadrilateral figures, a square is that which is both equilateral and right-angled; an oblong is that which is right-angled but not equilateral; a rhombus is that which is equilateral but not right-angled; and a rhomboid is that which has its opposite sides and angles equal to one another but is neither equilateral nor right-angled. And let quadrilateral other than these be called trapezia.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!--------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>23</b>: Parallel straight lines are straight lines which, being in the same plane and being produced indefinitely in both directions, do not meet one another in either direction.
