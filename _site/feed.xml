Today, we want to prove the existence of the elementary divisor decomposition. To do this, we will show instead the existence of the invariant factor decomposition. But when we show this, it turns out that it implies something for a larger class than just finite abelian groups. It’s going to imply this any finitely generated abelian groups.

Definition

<div class="mintbodydiv">
A group \(G\) is finitely generated if \(G = \langle S \rangle\) where \(S\) is a finite subset of \(G\), \(S \subseteq G\) 
</div>
<p><br />
Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, every cyclic is finitely generated by this definition (by a subset of one element). An example is \(\mathbf{Z}\). It is infinite but it is finitely generated by an element.</li> 
<li>Every finite group \(G\) is finitely generated. \(G = \langle G \rangle\).</li>
<li>\(D_{\infty} = \langle r, j \rangle\)</li>
<li>\((\mathbf{Q},+)\), the group of rational numbers with addition is not finitely generated.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have the following fact

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(G \cong H\), \(G\) is finitely generated if and only if \(H\) is finitely generated.

So being finitely generated is isomorphic invariant. What we want to prove is the following

<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(G\) is finitely generated, abelian, then
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	G \cong \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_1} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_2} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_k}

</div>
<p>When we prove this theorem, then for finite abelian groups, we won’t have terms like \(\mathbf{Z}\) since they are finite. So we will get exactly the invariant factor form out of this. So this proposition will essentially give us the existence of invariant factor decomposition. It will take this lecture and probably the next lecture

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proving the Existence of Invariant Factor Decomposition Plan</b></h4>
<p>So now we want to describe the steps involved in this proof:</p>

<ol>
	<!-------------------STEP 1--------------------->
	<li> If \(G\) is finitely generated and abelian, then we will see that
		<div>
			$$
			\begin{align*}
			G &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}^m/N \text{ where } \mathbf{Z}^m = \mathbf{Z} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}
			\end{align*}
			$$
		</div>
		In fact, what we will really show is that there exists a surjective homomorphism
		<div>
			$$
			\begin{align*}
			\phi: \mathbf{Z}^m \rightarrow G
			\end{align*}
			$$
		</div>
		Since we have a surjective homomorphism, we can then use the isomorphism theorem to conclude that 
		<div>
			$$
			\begin{align*}
			G \cong \mathbf{Z}^m / (N = ker(\phi))
			\end{align*}
			$$
		</div>
	</li>
	<!-------------------STEP 2--------------------->
	<li>We want to know something about the subgroup \(N\). So we will show that every subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}^m\) is finitely generated (won't be easy) and abelian. As a consequence, we will get that there exists a surjective homomorphism
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		\mathbf{Z}^n \xrightarrow{\rho} N \xrightarrow{i} \mathbf{Z}^m
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
	From this we can form the composite homomorphism \(\alpha = i \circ \rho\) between \(\mathbf{Z}^n\) and \(\mathbf{Z}^m\).<br />
	Notice above that the subgroup \(N\) must be the image of \(alpha\) so \(N = \alpha(\mathbf{Z}^n)\). So, now we can re-write what we have to be
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		 G \cong \mathbf{Z}^m / \alpha(\mathbf{Z}^n)
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
	For some homomorphism \(\alpha: \mathbf{Z}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}^m\). We still don't know what \(\alpha\) is but now the question of understanding finitely generated abelian can be reduced to a question of understanding homomorphisms.
	</li>
	<!-------------------STEP 3--------------------->
	<li>Every homomorphism \(\alpha: \mathbf{Z}^m \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}^n\) is of the form
		<div>
			$$
			\begin{align*}
			 L_A: \ &amp;\mathbf{Z}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}^m \\
			      &amp;L_A(x) = Ax
			\end{align*}
			$$
		</div>
	where \(A \in Mat_{m \times n}(\mathbf{Z})\) and \(x = [x_1 \ x_2 \ ... \ x_n]^T \in \mathbf{Z}_n, x_i \in \mathbf{Z} \).
	<br />
	So any homomorphism from \(\mathbf{Z}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}^m\) can be written as a left multiplication by a matrix \(A\). So now we can write
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		 G \cong \mathbf{Z}^m / L_A(\mathbf{Z}^n)
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
	So we're reducing the problem to linear algebra over the integers.
	</li>
	<!-------------------STEP 4--------------------->
	<li>Say \(P \in Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbf{Z})\) is integer invertible if \(P^{-1}\) exists and \(P^{-1} \in Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbf{Z}) \).<br /> Then,
			
	if \(B = PAQ\), where \(P, Q\) are integer invertible, then
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		 G \cong \mathbf{Z}^m / L_A(\mathbf{Z}^n) \cong \mathbf{Z}^m / L_B(\mathbf{Z}^n)
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
	The goal is that if we didn't want \(A\) or \(A\) wasn't in the right form, we can put it in standard form (smith normal form) and use a matrix that we want.
	</li>
	<!-------------------STEP 5--------------------->
	<li>A matrix \(D \in Mat_{m \times n}(\mathbf{Z})\) is a Smith normal form if
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		D = 
		\begin{pmatrix}
		d_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
		0 &amp; d_2 &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; 0 \\
		0 &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; 0 \\
		0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; d_s &amp; 0 \\
		\end{pmatrix}
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
	where \(d_i \geq 0\) and \(d_i \ | \ d_{i+1}\). Since, it doesn't need to be a square matrix, then the last column(s) might just be zero. <br />
	If we have this, then the claim is that
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		\mathbf{Z}^m / L_D(\mathbf{Z}^n) \cong \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_1} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_2} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_s} \times \mathbf{Z}^{m-s}  
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
	</li>
	<!-------------------STEP 6--------------------->
	<li>For every \(A \in Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbf{Z})\) there exists a integer invertible \(P, Q\), such that
	\(D = PAQ\) is a Smith normal form. This implies that
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		 G \cong \mathbf{Z}^m / L_A(\mathbf{Z}^n) \cong \mathbf{Z}^m / L_D(\mathbf{Z}^n)
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So what we did here is that we turned the problem into a problem about quotients by the image of a homomorphism that looked liked a left multiplication by a matrix. And then we took this matrix and put it in a Smith normal form. This leads to the form we want.
<br />

<h4><b>Proof Setup: Definitions</b></h4>
<p>Before starting with the proof, we need some setup, starting with this definition.
<br /></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
If \(G\) is an abelian group with addition. A subset \(S \subseteq G\) is linearly independent if \(\forall \ a_1,...,a_n \in S\) and \(\forall \ c_1,...,c_n \in \mathbf{Z}\), If 
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		 c_1a_1 + ... + c_na_n = 0
		\end{align*}
		$$
then, \(c_1 = ... =c_n = 0\).
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
In Vector Spaces, the \(c_i\)s are scalars.
<br />
<br />
Example: Suppose \(S \subseteq G\) and \(S = \{a\}\). What does it mean for \(S\) to be linearly independent? <br />
From the definition, \(S\) is linearly indenpendent if</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\forall c \in \mathbf{Z}, \quad ca = 0
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Then this implies that \(c = 0\). So no matter what \(c\) is if \(ca = 0\) only implies that \(c = 0\). So \(a\) must have infinite order (\(o(a) = \infty\)). This isn’t the same for subsets with more than 1 element. <br />
We also have the notion of a basis
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br /></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
A basis \(B\) of \(G\) is a subset \(B \subseteq G\) which is linearly independent and generates \(G\)

		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Example 1: \(\{1\}\) is a basis for \(\mathbf{Z}\)
<br />
<br />
Example 2: \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) has no basis. Why? we can’t have non-empty linear independent. Because if we have a non-empty subset with only element, this element will have infinite order.
<br />
<br />
So unlike Vector Space, not every abelian group will have a basis
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h4><b>Subgroups of Finitely Generated Groups</b></h4>
<p>[Lecture 24]. So given a finitely generated group \(G = \langle a_1,...,a_n \rangle\). We want to know is this property of being finitely generated inherited? Do subgroups and quotient groups of \(G\) are also finitely generated? If we have a normal subgroup \(N\). Is \(G/N\) finitely generated? The answer is actually yes. In fact, can write \(G/N = \langle a_1N,...a_nN \rangle\). So quotients of finitely generated groups are finitely generated as well. 
<br />
<br />
One thing to note here is that one of these elements will turn out to be the identity element and since it’s the identity, then we don’t need to keep it in the generators list. So \(G/N = \langle a_1N_1,...a_{n-1}N \rangle\). We can throw one of the elements out. (explain more?)
<br />
<br />
A related question to this. If we have a subgroup \(H \leq G\) where \(G\) is finitely generated. Is \(H\) finitely generated? The answer is actually no. It doesn’t need to be. In fact, only if \(G\) is finitely generated and abelian, then every subgroup \(H \leq G\) is also finitely generated. We will prove this but to do so, we’ll prove the following required lemma first.
<br />
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Lemma
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(H\) be an (abelian) group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup of \(H\) (\(N\) is always normal since \(H\) is abelian). If \(N\) and \(H/N\) are finitely generated, then \(H\) is finitely generated. 
</div>
<p><br />
Note here that this lemma in fact works for all groups with a normal subgroup and not just abelian groups but right now we only care about the abelian case and it will also make the proof easier.
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Suppose \(N\) is a normal subgroup of \(H\) and suppose that both \(N\) and \(H/N\) are finitely generated. Then, we can write</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	N &amp;= \mathbf{Z}\{x_1,...,x_m\} \\
	H/N &amp;= \mathbf{Z}\{\bar{y_1},...,\bar{y_n}\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Now, for each \(\bar{y_i}\), pick \(y_i \in H\) such that \(\bar{y_i} = y_i + N\). So \(y_i\) is the representative for this coset. Another way to think about this is to remember that we have the quotient homomorphism \(\pi\) where</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\pi: H &amp;\longrightarrow H/N \\
	     \pi(y_i) &amp;= \bar{y_i}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Given this, we claim that \(H\) is generated by \(\mathbf{Z}\{x_1,...,x_m,y_1,...,y_n\}\). So we’re combining the elements of \(N\) and all the representatives of the cosets. This gives us a generating set for \(H\) itself. To see why it’s true. Suppose that \(u \in H\). The goal is to write \(u\) in terms of the elements in our claim. Consider the image of \(u\) under \(\pi\). Its image is in the quotient group \(H/N\) so we can write</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	v = \pi(u) = b_1\bar{y_1} + ... + b_n\bar{y_n} \in H/N \quad \text{ for some } b_i \in \mathbf{Z}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We can do this because the set \(\{\bar{y_1},...,\bar{y_n}\}\) generates \(H/N\). So we can write \(v\) as a linear combination of the elements in the set like we did. Now define \(\hat{v}\) to be an element in \(H\). We can also write it</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\hat{v} = b_1y_1 + ... + b_ny_n \in H
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We can do this because each \(y_i\) is in \(H\) and \(H\) is closed so \(\hat{v}\) is in \(H\). 
Observe that \(\pi(\hat{v}) = v\) because we defined earlier that \(\pi(y_i) = \bar{y_i}\). So now we have</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\pi(u) &amp;= v = \pi(\hat{v})
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now calculate \(\pi(u - \hat{v})\), we will see that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\pi(u - \hat{v}) &amp;= v - v = 0
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This means that \(u - \hat{v}\) is in the kernel of \(\pi\) which means that \(u - \hat{v} \in N\). But \(N\) is finitely generated so we can express \(u - \hat{v}\) in terms of the elements in \(N\) so</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	u - \hat{v} = a_1x_1 + ... + a_nx_n \in N \text{ where } a_i \in \mathbf{Z} \\
	u = (a_1x_1 + ... + a_nx_n) + (b_1y_1 + ... + b_ny_n)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So this says that any element in \(H\) can be written interms of those factors which means that \(H\) is finitely generated. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
Now we’re ready to prove the main theorem
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
If \(G\) is finitely generated and abelian, then every subgroup \(H \leq G\) is also finitely generated.
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\{a_1,...,a_n\}\) and \(H \leq G\). We want to show that \(H\) is finitely generated. We will show this by  induction on the size of generating set.
<br />
<br />
Base Case: <br />
If \(n = 0\), then \(G = \mathbf{Z}\{\} = \{e\}\). So \(G\) is the trivial group. <br />
If \(n = 1\), then, \(G = \mathbf{Z}\{a\}\). So \(G\) is cyclic. Any subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic. 
<br />
<br />
Inductive Case: \((n \geq 2)\). Let \(a_n = a\) in the generators list just to make it easy to read.<br />
First, since \(G\) is abelian, then all of \(G\)’s subgroups are normal. Consider the subgroup generated by the last element in the list of generators in \(G\). So \(\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\). This subgroup is normal. Now, consider the intersection of \(H\) and \(\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\). This is also a subgroup of both \(\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\) and \(H\) by the Diamond Isomorphism Theorem. In fact, we will get the following diagram.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec24/1.png" width="35%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Now, let the intersection \(H \cap \mathbf{Z}\{a\}\) be \(N\). We will take the quotient group \(H/N\). Similarly, we have another quotient group \(H + \mathbf{Z}\{a\}/\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\). These two quotient groups are isomorphic by the Diamond Isomorphism Theorem.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec24/2.png" width="65%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Next, take the quotient group \(G/\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\). Notice here that \(H + \mathbf{Z}\) is a subgroup of \(G\) and that we’re taking the quotient by the same subgroup \(\mathbf{Z}\). Therefore, by the correspondance theorem, we will see that \(H + \mathbf{Z}\{a\}/\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\) is a subgroup of \(G/\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec24/3.png" width="72%" class="center" /></p>

<p>So now, observe that \(G\) is generated by \(n\) elements. The group \(G/\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\) is generated by \(n-1\) elements. Why? Recall that we said earlier that since the subgroup has one element \(a\) from the generators, then this element will be come the identity element in the quotient group and we don’t need to include it in the list of generators for the quotient group.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec24/4.png" width="72%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Also note, that \(\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\) is a subgroup generated by one element so it’s cyclic and so it’s finitely generated. Since the intersection \(N = \mathbf{Z}\{a\}\) is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\), then it’s also cyclic and finitely generated.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec24/5.png" width="77%" class="center" /></p>

<p>We can now use the induction hypothesis to say that since \(G/\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\) is generated by \(n-1\) elements, then all its subgroups are also finitely generated. But this group is isomorphic to \(H/H \cap \mathbf{Z}\{a\} = H/N\). So \(H/N\) is also finitely generated.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec24/6.png" width="77%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Finally, we can use the lemma to say that since \(H/N\) is finitely generated and since \(N\) is finitely generated, then \(H\) is finitely generated as we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\).

Today, we want to prove the existence of the elementary divisor decomposition. To do this, we will show instead the existence of the invariant factor decomposition. But when we show this, it turns out that it implies something for a larger class than just finite abelian groups. It’s going to imply this any finitely generated abelian groups. Definition A group \(G\) is finitely generated if \(G = \langle S \rangle\) where \(S\) is a finite subset of \(G\), \(S \subseteq G\) Examples: For example, every cyclic is finitely generated by this definition (by a subset of one element). An example is \(\mathbf{Z}\). It is infinite but it is finitely generated by an element. Every finite group \(G\) is finitely generated. \(G = \langle G \rangle\). \(D_{\infty} = \langle r, j \rangle\) \((\mathbf{Q},+)\), the group of rational numbers with addition is not finitely generated. We also have the following fact Proposition If \(G \cong H\), \(G\) is finitely generated if and only if \(H\) is finitely generated. So being finitely generated is isomorphic invariant. What we want to prove is the following Proposition If \(G\) is finitely generated, abelian, then $$ \begin{align*} G \cong \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_1} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_2} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_k} \end{align*} $$ For some \(d_1,...,d_k \geq 0, k \geq 0, d_i \ | \ d_{i+1}\) Example: Suppose \(G\) has \(d_i = 1,3,12,12,720,0,0\) Then $$ \begin{align*} G &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{1} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{3} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{12} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{12} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{720} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{0} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{0} \\ &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{3} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{12} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{12} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{720} \times \mathbf{Z} \times \mathbf{Z} \\ &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{3} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{12} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{12} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{720} \times \mathbf{Z}^2 \end{align*} $$ When we prove this theorem, then for finite abelian groups, we won’t have terms like \(\mathbf{Z}\) since they are finite. So we will get exactly the invariant factor form out of this. So this proposition will essentially give us the existence of invariant factor decomposition. It will take this lecture and probably the next lecture Proving the Existence of Invariant Factor Decomposition Plan So now we want to describe the steps involved in this proof:]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Study Notes: Semidirect Products</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/16/math417-extra-semidirect-products.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Study Notes: Semidirect Products" /><published>2025-02-16T00:01:36-08:00</published><updated>2025-02-16T00:01:36-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/16/math417-extra-semidirect-products</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/16/math417-extra-semidirect-products.html"><![CDATA[<p>The reference video is an excellent video on Semidirect Products. The following are just notes so I can fully follow along.
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Inner Semidirect Product Group</b></h4>
<p>Suppose we’re given two subgroups \(H, K \leq G\). We also know that \(HK = G\) and \(H \cap K = \{e\}\) (in this case, we call \(H\) and \(K\) complements). Consider the map</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: H \times K &amp;\rightarrow G \\
	              (h,k)  &amp;\rightarrow hk
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We want to show that \(\phi\) is a bijection. To do this, we’ll first show that \(\phi\) is injective. So given the elements \(h_1, h_2 \in H\) and \(k_1, k_2 \in K\) such that \(\phi(h_1,k_1) = \phi(h_2,k_2)\), we want to show that \((h_1,k_1) = (h_2,k_2)\). Observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(h_1,k_1) &amp;= \phi(h_2,k_2) \\
	h_1k_1 &amp;= h_2k_2 \\
	(h_2)^{-1}h_1k_1 &amp;= k_2 \\
	(h_2)^{-1}h_1k_1k_1^{-1} &amp;= k_2k_1^{-1} \\
	(h_2)^{-1}h_1 &amp;= k_2k_1^{-1} \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Since \((h_2)^{-1}h_1 \in H\) and \(k_2k_1^{-1} \in K\) and \((h_2)^{-1}h_1 = k_2k_1^{-1}\), then this value must be in the intersection \(H \cap K\). But \(H \cap K = \{e\}\). Therefore, this must be the identity element and so</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(h_2)^{-1}h_1 &amp;= k_2k_1^{-1} = e
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>But this just means that \((h_2)^{-1}h_1 = e\) and so \(h_1 = h_2\) and similarly \(k_1 = k_2\). Therefore \((h_1,k_1) = (h_2,k_2)\). So \(\phi\) is injective.
<br />
<br />
Next, we want to show that \(\phi\) is surjective. Notice that \(Im(\phi) = \{hk \ | \ h \in H, k \in K\} = HK = G\). This just means that \(\phi\) is surjective since the codomain in \(G\). Therefore, \(\phi\) is a bijection. 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>How to Make \(\phi\) a Homomorphism</b></h4>
<p>Now, suppose that we’re also given that \(H\) is normal. We know that \(\phi: H \times G \rightarrow G\) is a bijection. We also know that \(G\) is a group but we never defined \(H \times K\) as a group. We just said it was a set. The question is can we make \(H \times K\) a group so that \(\phi\) isn’t just a bijection but also an isomorphism? (hmmm, this is a iff right?)
<br />
<br />
We already know \(\phi\) is a bijection so we only need to show that \(\phi\) is a homomorphism. To be a homomorphism we need to prove that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi((h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2)) = \phi((h_1,k_1))\phi((h_2,k_2))
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Notice that we have NOT defined what the product will look like but we know that the right hand side is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	h_1k_1h_2k_2
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The goal is to write this product as a product of an element in \(H\) multiplied by an element from \(K\). This is exactly why we wanted or need \(H\) to be normal. So insert \(k_1^{-1}k_1\) as follows</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	h_1k_1h_2k_2 &amp;= h_1k_1h_2 (k_1^{-1}k_1) k_2 \\
	             &amp;= (h_1)(k_1h_2k_1^{-1}) (k_1k_2) \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Note here that the first two elements are in \(H\). \(h_1 \in H\) and \(k_1h_2k_1^{-1} \in H\) since \(H\) is normal. So we have exactly what we want. Why do we care? we want this because now we can write this as \(\phi\) of some \((h,k) \in H \times K\) where \(h = (h_1)(k_1h_2k_1^{-1})\) and \(k = (k_1k_2)\). So</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi((h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2)) &amp;= \phi((h_1,k_1))\phi((h_2,k_2)) \\
	                         &amp;= h_1k_1h_2k_2 \\
							 &amp;= (h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}) (k_1k_2) \\
	                         &amp;= \phi((h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}), k_1k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>

<p>But remember that \(\phi\) is a bijection so it’s injective. So saying that \(\phi((h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2)) = \phi((h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}), k_1k_2)\) implies that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) = (h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}, k_1k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This immediately gives us the required operation for \(G \times H\) to be a group. If we define this product above to be how we multiply elements in \(H \times K\), then \(\phi\) is a homomorphism and therefore, it is an isomorphism from \(G \times H \rightarrow G\). Since we already use \(G \times H\) to denote the direct product group, we use the notation \(G \rtimes K\) to denote this semidirect product group (internal semi direct product).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Outer Semidirect Product Group</b></h4>
<p>So now consider the groups \(H\) and \(K\). \(H\) and \(K\) are just two groups. They are not necessarily subgroups of \(G\). We want to find \(G\) such that \(G\) satisfies the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>\(H_G\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\)</li>
	<li>\(K_G\) is a subgroup of \(G\)</li>
	<li>\(H_G \cap K = \{e\}\)</li>
	<li>\(H_GK_G = G\)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that \(H_G\) is a subgroup of \(G\) that is isomorphic to \(H\) so it might not be \(H\) but at least it’s isomorphic to \(H\). So our goal here is to take two groups and make a new group such that this new group \(G\) is isomorphic to their direct product \(H \times K\).
<br />
<br />
So how can we make a group that satisfies these conditions? It’s important to remember that we don’t know anything about \(H\) or \(K\) and they might not be related. So we can’t just multiply \(hk\). We need a way to treat the elements of \(H\) and the elements of \(K\) separately. One way to do this is to use ordered pairs. What we can do is define the set of elements \(H \times K\) to be</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 H \times K = \{(h, k) \ | \ h \in H, k \in K\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This way, they stay separate. Additionally, this makes it easier to find the subgroups that we need. For example, we can define</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 H_G = H \times \{e_k\} &amp;= \{(h,e_K) \ | \ h \in H \} \quad \text{with the group product}\\
	 (h_1, e_K)&amp;(h_2, e_K) = (h_1h_2, e_K)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>And similarly define \(K_G\) as</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 K_G = \{e_H\} \times K &amp;= \{(e_H, k) \ | \ h \in H \}  \quad \text{with the group product}\\
	 (e_H, k_1)&amp;(e_H, k_2) = (e_H, k_1k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Using this construction, we can see that \(H_G \cap K_G = \{(e_H,e_K)\}\). Next, we want to show that \(H_GK_G = G\). By construction, \(H_GK_G = \{(h,e)(e,k)\}\). We defined \(G = H \times K\). What we want is have \(H_GK_G = G = H \times K\). In other words, we want</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 H_GK_G &amp;= \{(h,e)(e,k)\} = \{(h,k)\} = H \times K = G \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>One way to do this is to define the group \(H \times K\)’s product to be</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(h,e)(e,k) = (h,k)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This works and gives us the condition \(H_GK_G = G\). But this defines the product for these edge cases. What about the product of arbitrary elements \((h_1,k_1), (h_2,k_2) \in G = H \times K\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) &amp;= (h_1, e)(e, k_1)(h_2, e)(e, k_2) \quad \text{(using the product we defined)} \\
	                    &amp;=(h_1, e)(e, k_1)(h_2,e)[(e,k_1^{-1})(e,k_1)](e, k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Remember that we want \(H\) to be normal. So we’ll use the same trick from the inner product group in the first section and insert \((e,k_1^{-1})(e,k_1)\) in the middle. This means that \((e, k_1)(h_2,e)(e,k_1^{-1}) \in H\)
<br />
<br />
Now recall that conjugation by a element in a group is an automorphism.</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	   \gamma: G &amp;\rightarrow Aut(G) \\
	   \gamma_g(x) &amp;\rightarrow gxg^{-1}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>What is \(\gamma_{gh}\)?</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	   \gamma_{gh}(x) &amp;= ghx(gh)^{-1}  \\
	                  &amp;= g(hxh^{-1})g^{-1} \\
					  &amp;= g(\gamma_{h}(x))g^{-1} \\
					  &amp;= \gamma_g(\gamma_h(x)) \\
					  &amp;= \gamma_g \circ \gamma_h(x)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So \(\gamma\) is a group homomorphism. So going back to the group \(H \times K\)</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) &amp;=(h_1, e)[(e, k_1)(h_2,e)(e,k_1^{-1})](e,k_1)(e, k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We know that \(H_G\) is normal so if we conjugate any element in \(H_G\), the map will send it back to \(H_G\). So define the map</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	   \gamma: K &amp;\rightarrow Aut(H) \\
	   \gamma_k(x) &amp;\rightarrow khk^{-1}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We can use this to write the product</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) &amp;=(h_1, e)(\gamma_{k_1}(h_2),e)(e,k_1)(e, k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This \(\gamma\) just describes the conjugation of \(h_2\) by \(k_1\). And we already saw that this map is a homomorphism. Moreover, we can see the product above is now</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) &amp;=(h_1, e)(\gamma_{k_1}(h_2),e)(e,k_1)(e, k_2) \\
	                    &amp;=(h_1\gamma_{k_1}(h_2), e)(e, k_1k_2) \\
						&amp;=(h_1\gamma_{k_1}(h_2), k_1k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Which is exactly why the semidirect product is defined that way!!!!!!!!!!
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Take \(D_{2n}\). We need to find two subgroups that are complements in \(D_{2n}\). The subgroups are \(\langle r \rangle\) and \(\langle s \rangle\) are complements in \(D_{2n}\). To see why.</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(\langle r \rangle \langle s \rangle = D_{2n}\). Every element in \(D_{2n}\) can be written as \(r^ke \in \langle r \rangle\) or \(r^ks \in \langle s \rangle\). </li>
	<li>\(\langle r \rangle \cap \langle s \rangle = \{e\}\). But we know that \(\langle s \rangle = \{s, e\}\) and we know that \(s \not\in \langle r \rangle\) so we're done.</li>
</ul>
<p>So they are complements. The last condition we need is that one of the subgroups is normal. But we know that \(\langle r \rangle\) is normal. (We’ve shown this before).
<br />
<br />
Since we have all the conditions, then we can write</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	D_{2n} \cong \langle r \rangle \rtimes_{\gamma} \langle s \rangle
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The product will be</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(r^a, h_1)(r^b, h_2) = (r^{a}(h_1r^bh_1^{-1}), h_1h_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Since we know how to multiply elements in the dihedral group, this gives us a complete description of the semidirect product. But we can further describe this multiplication more abstractly if we let</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
    h_1r^bh_1^{-1} &amp;=  \gamma_{h_1}(r^b)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is the \(\gamma\) in the semidirect product above. \(\gamma\) tells us how to conjugate the elements. So if we define \(\gamma\) for each of the elements in both subgroups, then this gives us a way to abstract the multiplication. Since we only have two elements in \(\langle s \rangle\), then we can list what \(\gamma\) does for each element</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
     \gamma_{e}(r^b) &amp;= er^be^{-1} = r^b. \\
	 \gamma_{s}(r^b) &amp;= sr^bs^{-1} = (r^{-b}s)s^{-1} = r^{-b}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This gives up a complete description of the conjugation without ever talking about the actual multiplication. So now we can re-write the product as</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
    (r^a, h_1)(r^b, h_2) = (r^{a}\gamma_{h_1}(r^b), h_1h_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The big reason that we want to replace the conjugation with \(\gamma\) though is we don’t have elements multiplying between the two subgroups. This means that we can further abstract this with different groups that are isomorphic to the subgroups we have. In particular, we know that in \(D_{2n}\), \(\langle r \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_n\). The isomorphism is given by</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
    \langle r \rangle &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n \\
	               r^k  &amp;\rightarrow k 
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Similarly \(\langle s \rangle \mathbf{Z}_2\). The isomorphism is given by</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
    \langle s \rangle &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\
	               e  &amp;\rightarrow 0 \\
				   s &amp;\rightarrow 1
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now we can take the semidirect product that we have and replace \(\langle r \rangle\) and \(\langle s \rangle\) with their isomorphic groups \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) and \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). So we can re-write the semidirect product as</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	D_{2n} \cong \mathbf{Z}_n \rtimes_{\gamma} \mathbf{Z}_2
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now, the elements will no longer be \((r^k, h)\). Instead, they will be their images under the isomorphisms we designed. So instead of writing \(r^k\), we will write its image \(k\) and instead of writing \(e\) or \(s\), we will write 0 or 1. So</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	D_{2n} &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}_n \rtimes_{\gamma} \mathbf{Z}_2 \\
	(r^k, h)    &amp;\rightarrow          (a, x)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>And the product will be</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(r^a, h_1)(r^b, h_2) &amp;= (r^{a}\gamma_{h_1}(r^b), h_1h_2) \\
	               &amp;\rightarrow \\
   (a, x)(b, y) &amp;= (a+\gamma_{x}(b), x+y)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Note here that the group operation is now addition! The last thing we need to do is define what this new \(\gamma\) is. This will be easy since we can take the \(\gamma\) we already defined and change it to</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
     \gamma_{0}(b) &amp;= b. \\
	 \gamma_{1}(b) &amp;= -b.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To further see how this works, it’s helpful to look at more examples of how the multiplication works in the older semidirect vs. the new one.</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}

The following are just notes so I can fully follow along. Inner Semidirect Product Group Suppose we’re given two subgroups \(H, K \leq G\). We also know that \(HK = G\) and \(H \cap K = \{e\}\) (in this case, we call \(H\) and \(K\) complements). Consider the map $$ \begin{align*} \phi: H \times K &amp;\rightarrow G \\ (h,k) &amp;\rightarrow hk \end{align*} $$ We want to show that \(\phi\) is a bijection. To do this, we’ll first show that \(\phi\) is injective. So given the elements \(h_1, h_2 \in H\) and \(k_1, k_2 \in K\) such that \(\phi(h_1,k_1) = \phi(h_2,k_2)\), we want to show that \((h_1,k_1) = (h_2,k_2)\). Observe that $$ \begin{align*} \phi(h_1,k_1) &amp;= \phi(h_2,k_2) \\ h_1k_1 &amp;= h_2k_2 \\ (h_2)^{-1}h_1k_1 &amp;= k_2 \\ (h_2)^{-1}h_1k_1k_1^{-1} &amp;= k_2k_1^{-1} \\ (h_2)^{-1}h_1 &amp;= k_2k_1^{-1} \\ \end{align*} $$ Since \((h_2)^{-1}h_1 \in H\) and \(k_2k_1^{-1} \in K\) and \((h_2)^{-1}h_1 = k_2k_1^{-1}\), then this value must be in the intersection \(H \cap K\). But \(H \cap K = \{e\}\). Therefore, this must be the identity element and so $$ \begin{align*} (h_2)^{-1}h_1 &amp;= k_2k_1^{-1} = e \end{align*} $$ But this just means that \((h_2)^{-1}h_1 = e\) and so \(h_1 = h_2\) and similarly \(k_1 = k_2\). Therefore \((h_1,k_1) = (h_2,k_2)\). So \(\phi\) is injective. Next, we want to show that \(\phi\) is surjective. Notice that \(Im(\phi) = \{hk \ | \ h \in H, k \in K\} = HK = G\). This just means that \(\phi\) is surjective since the codomain in \(G\). Therefore, \(\phi\) is a bijection. How to Make \(\phi\) a Homomorphism Now, suppose that we’re also given that \(H\) is normal. We know that \(\phi: H \times G \rightarrow G\) is a bijection. We also know that \(G\) is a group but we never defined \(H \times K\) as a group. We just said it was a set. The question is can we make \(H \times K\) a group so that \(\phi\) isn’t just a bijection but also an isomorphism? (hmmm, this is a iff right?) We already know \(\phi\) is a bijection so we only need to show that \(\phi\) is a homomorphism. To be a homomorphism we need to prove that $$ \begin{align*} \phi((h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2)) = \phi((h_1,k_1))\phi((h_2,k_2)) \end{align*} $$ Notice that we have NOT defined what the product will look like but we know that the right hand side is $$ \begin{align*} h_1k_1h_2k_2 \end{align*} $$ The goal is to write this product as a product of an element in \(H\) multiplied by an element from \(K\). This is exactly why we wanted or need \(H\) to be normal. So insert \(k_1^{-1}k_1\) as follows $$ \begin{align*} h_1k_1h_2k_2 &amp;= h_1k_1h_2 (k_1^{-1}k_1) k_2 \\ &amp;= (h_1)(k_1h_2k_1^{-1}) (k_1k_2) \\ \end{align*} $$ Note here that the first two elements are in \(H\). \(h_1 \in H\) and \(k_1h_2k_1^{-1} \in H\) since \(H\) is normal. So we have exactly what we want. Why do we care? we want this because now we can write this as \(\phi\) of some \((h,k) \in H \times K\) where \(h = (h_1)(k_1h_2k_1^{-1})\) and \(k = (k_1k_2)\). So $$ \begin{align*} \phi((h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2)) &amp;= \phi((h_1,k_1))\phi((h_2,k_2)) \\ &amp;= h_1k_1h_2k_2 \\ &amp;= (h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}) (k_1k_2) \\ &amp;= \phi((h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}), k_1k_2) \end{align*} $$]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Study Notes: Isomorphism Theorem Examples</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/15/math417-extra-isomorphism-examples.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Study Notes: Isomorphism Theorem Examples" /><published>2025-02-15T00:01:36-08:00</published><updated>2025-02-15T00:01:36-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/15/math417-extra-isomorphism-examples</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/15/math417-extra-isomorphism-examples.html"><![CDATA[<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<p>Let \(Q_8 = \{1, -1, i, i, j, -j, k, -k\}\) be a group. We have the identities:</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, \quad ij = k, \quad ji = -k, \quad ijk = -1
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p><br />
\(ij = k\) is going in a clockwise direction while \(ji = -k\) is going in a counter clockwise direction.
TODO: Group diagram.
<br />
<br />
There are three cyclic subgroups of order 4: \(\langle i \rangle\), \(\langle j \rangle\) and \(\langle k \rangle\). There is one cyclic group of order 2: \(\langle -1 \rangle\). Note that \(\langle i \rangle = \{1, i, -1, -i\}\). 
<br />
<br />
Let’s find the cosets of \(\langle i \rangle\) in \(Q_8\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	j\langle i \rangle &amp;= j\{1, i, -1, -i\} = \{j, -k, -j, k\} \\
	\langle i \rangle j &amp;= \{1, i, -1, -i\}j = \{j, k, -j, -k\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Note that \(Q_8\) is generated by two elements \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (easy to check). Therefore, since \(j\langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle j\) and we checked all the generators of the group, then \(\langle i \rangle\) is a normal subgroup.
<br />
<br />
Let’s study the quotient group \(Q_8 / \langle i \rangle\). We know that it must contain two elements (By Lagrange’s Theorem).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	Q_8 / \langle i \rangle = \{\langle i \rangle, j \langle i \rangle\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p><br />
<br />
Recall, that we defined the multiplication of cosets by \((xN)(yN)=(xy)N\). Since we have two elements, observe that \(\langle i \rangle \langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle\). Multiply \(j \langle i \rangle\) by \(\langle i \rangle\) is just \(j \langle i \rangle\). Remember that \(\langle i \rangle\) acts as the identity element/coset here. So the only interesting product is \((j\langle i \rangle) (j\langle i \rangle)\) [TODO: add a table]</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(j\langle i \rangle) (j\langle i \rangle) &amp;= j^2 \langle i \rangle = -\langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle. 
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This multiplication table looks like the multiplication table of \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). In fact \(Q_8 / \langle i \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<p>Taking \(Q_8\) from before, let’s look at at the cyclic group generated by \(\langle -1 \rangle\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-1, 1\} 
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(\langle -1 \rangle\) is a normal subgroup (easy check, every element in the subgroup commutes with all elements in \(Q_8\)). So we now look at the quotient structure. (the cosets of \(\langle -1 \rangle\) in \(Q_8\))</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	i \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-i, i\} \\
	j \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-j, j\} \\
	k \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-k, k\} \\
	Q_8 / \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{i \langle -1 \rangle , i \langle -1 \rangle, j \langle -1 \rangle, k \langle -1 \rangle \}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Let’s calculate the order of each element. For example, \((i \langle -1 \rangle)^2 = -1\langle -1 \rangle = \langle -1 \rangle\). So \(o(i\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\). In fact, we also have \(o(j\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\) and \(o(k\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\). This isn’t cyclic so this group must be isomorphic to the non-cyclic group of order 4. So it’s isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_2\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 3</b></h4>
<p>Suppose that we are given</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: \mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n \\
	                 &amp;\phi(m) = [m] = \{k \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ k \equiv m (\bmod n)\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We want to show that \(\phi(m)\) is surjective. This is because for all \(0 \leq m \leq m - 1\), \(\phi(m) = [m]\) So we are able to hit every value of \(m\). It is also a homomorphism. since</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(m_1 + m_2) = [m_1 + m_2] = [m_1] + [m_2] = \phi(m_1) + \phi(m_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The kernel of \(\phi\) is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ m \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ [m] = [0]\} \\
	           &amp;= \{0, \pm n, \pm 2n,....\} = n\mathbf{Z}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now we have \(\ker(\phi) = n\mathbf{Z}\). We know that it is normal. We also showed that \(\phi\) is a surjective homomorphism. Therefore, by the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}/n\mathbf{Z} \cong \mathbf{Z}_n\).
<br />
<br /></p>

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 4</b></h4>
<p>Next, let’s take</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: \mathbf{Z}_4 &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\
	        &amp;\phi([m]_4) = [m]_2 
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Here, it is not obvious this is well-defined. So let’s check that it is. Suppose that \([m_1]_4 = [m_2]_4\). We want to show that \(\phi([m_1]_4) = \phi([m_2]_4)\). Observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	[m_1]_4 &amp;= [m_2]_4 \\
	[m_1]_4 - [m_2]_4 &amp;= [0]_4 \\
	[m_1 - m_2]_4 &amp;= [0]_4 \\
	m_1-m_2 &amp;\equiv 0 \bmod 4
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This says that \(m_1 - m_2\) must be a multiple of 4 so \(m_1 - m_2 = 4k = 2(2k)\) for some \(k \in \mathbf{Z}\). So \(m_1 - m_2\) is also a multiple of 2. Therefore, \(m_1-m_2 \equiv 0 \bmod 2\) and so \([m_1]_2 = [m_2]_2\).
<br />
<br />
\(\phi\) is also a homomorphism. since</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi([m_1]_4 + [m_2]_4) = \phi([m_1 + m_2]_4) = [m_1 + m_2]_2 = [m_1]_2 + [m_2]_2 = \phi(m_1) + \phi(m_2).
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Next we want to show that \(\phi\) is surjective. Notice that there are two values in the target domain. \([0]_2\) and \([1]_2\). Also note that \(\phi([0]_4) = [0]_2\) and \(\phi([1]_4) = [1]_2\) so it is surjective.
<br />
<br />
The kernel of \(\phi\) is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ [m]_4 \in \mathbf{Z}_4 \ | \ \phi([m]_4) = [0]_2\} \\
	           &amp;= \{ [m]_4 \in \mathbf{Z}_4 \ | \ [m]_2 = [0]_2\} \\
			   &amp;= \{ [0]_4, [2]_4 \} = \langle [2]_4 \rangle = 2\mathbf{Z}_4 \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now we have \(\ker(\phi) = \langle [2]_4 \rangle\). We know that it is normal. We also showed that \(\phi\) is a surjective homomorphism. Therefore, by the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}_4/\langle [2]_4 \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 5</b></h4>
<p>Next, let’s take</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: \mathbf{Z}_6 &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_{15}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We need to figure out a homomorphism. First recall that for any element, \(|\phi(x)| \ | \ |x|\). Let’s list the order of the elements in \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\). Notice here that \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\) is a cyclic group (with addition) so the order of any element \(g + a\) is going to be \(\frac{15}{gcd(a,15)}\)</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	&amp;o(1): [0]_{15} \\
	&amp;o(3): [5]_{15}, [10]_{15} \\
	&amp;o(5): [3]_{15}, [6]_{15}, [9]_{15}, [12]_{15} \\
	&amp;o(15): [1]_{15}, [2]_{15}, [4]_{15}, [7]_{15}, [11]_{15}, [13]_{15}, [14]_{15} \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now let’s pick \([1]_{6}\). It is a generator for \(\mathbf{Z}_{6}\). We know that \(\phi([1]_6)\) must divide the order of the element itself so \(|[1]_6| = 6\). So that tells us that \(|\phi([1]_6)|\) must be either 1,2,3 or 6. 2 and 6 are not possibilities so we don’t have any elements of that order in \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\). So it’s either 1 or 3.
<br />
<br />
Case 1: Suppose we pick some element of order 1. That means that \(\phi([1]_6) = 1\). This implies that \(\phi([1]_6) = [0]_{15}\). Since it’s a generator, then \(\ker(\phi) = \mathbf{Z}_6\). And \(Im(\phi) = \{[0]_{15}\}\). This gives us \(\mathbf{Z}_6/\mathbf{Z}_6 = \{[0]_{15}\} \leq \mathbf{Z}_{15}\). So it’s pretty boring.
<br />
<br />
Case 2: Suppose we pick some element of order 3 so \(|\phi([1]_6)| = 3\). So let \(\phi([1]_6) = [5]_{15}\). Based on this, where will \([2]_6\) will go? Remember that we want \(\phi\) to be a homomorphism. This means that we want this to be true. That \(\phi([2]_6) = \phi([1 + 1]_6) = \phi([1]_6) + \phi([1]_6) = [5]_{15} + [5_{15} = [10]_{15}\). So we want to pick \([10]_{15}\) for \([2]_6\). Based on this, the elements will get mapped to</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	[0]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [0]_{15} \\
	[1]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [5]_{15} \\
	[2]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [10]_{15} \\
	[3]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [0]_{15} \\
	[4]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [5]_{15} \\
	[5]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [10]_{15}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So the image of our homomorphism is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	Im(\phi) = \{[0]_{15}, [5]_{15}, [10]_{15}\} = \langle [5]_{15} \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_3
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The last statement is because all cyclic groups of order 3 are isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_3\). The kernel of \(\phi\) is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ [m]_6 \in \mathbf{Z}_6 \ | \ \phi([m]_6) = [0]_{15}\} \\
			   &amp;= \{ [0]_6, [3]_{6} \} = \langle [3]_6 \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>By the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}_{6}/\langle [3]_6 \rangle \cong \langle [5]_{15} \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_3\).
<br />

<h4><b>Example 6</b></h4>
<p>Next, let’s take</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	D_n = \langle r,s \ | \ r^n = s^2 = e, rs = sr^{n-1} \rangle
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To define a homomorphism, we need these defining identities to hold on both sides. So let’s define</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: D_n &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\
	      r  &amp;\rightarrow 0 \quad \text{we don't to write $[0]_2$ since it's clear} \\
		  s &amp;\rightarrow 1
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now we need to verify that the three defining relations are satisfied. For example, we know that \(r^n = e\). So we want \(\phi(r^n) = \phi(e) = [0]\). But this is also</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(r^n) = \phi(rr...r) = \phi(r)+...\phi(r) = 0+...+0 = 0.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Similarly, we have \(\phi(s^2) = \phi(e) = [0]\) and at the same time</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(s^2) = \phi(ss) = \phi(s)+\phi(s) = 1 + 1 = 0
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Finally, we have \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{n-1})\). We can check both sides</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(rs) &amp;= \phi(r) + \phi(s) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\
	\phi(sr^{n-1}) &amp;= \phi(s) + \phi(r) + ... + \phi(r) = 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Next, we need to see that it is surjective but that’s trivial since we’re sending \(r\) to \(0\) and \(s\) to \(1\) so it’s definitely surjective. The image of \(\phi\) is \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). The kernel is also easy to see</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ l \in D_n \ | \ \phi(l) = 0\} \\
			   &amp;= \langle r \rangle \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is because any rotation is sent to 0 and any reflection \(\phi(r^ks) = \phi(sr^{n-k} = 1\).<br />
By the Isomorphism Theorem, \(D_n/\langle r \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 7</b></h4>
<p>Let’s continue with the dihedral group and suppose we have</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	D_n = \langle r,s \ | \ r^n = s^2 = e, rs = sr^{n-1} \rangle
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To define a homomorphism, we need these defining identities to hold on both sides. So let’s define</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: D_n &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n \\
	      r  &amp;\rightarrow 1 \\
		  s &amp;\rightarrow 0
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Is this a homomorphism? Let’s check the identity \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{n-1})\). We can check both sides</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(rs) &amp;= \phi(r) + \phi(s) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\
	\phi(sr^{n-1}) &amp;= \phi(s) + (\phi(r) + ... + \phi(r)) = 0 + n - 1 = n - 1.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Note that \(1 \not\equiv n - 1 \bmod n\) unless \(n = 2\). So it’s not a homomorphism for any \(n &gt; 2\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 8</b></h4>
<p>Let’s take another dihedral group example. Define</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	D_{2n} = \langle r,s \ | \ r^{2n} = s^2 = e, rs = sr^{2n-1} \rangle
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>And then define</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: D_{2n} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\
	      r  &amp;\rightarrow 1 \\
		  s &amp;\rightarrow 0
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We need to verify that the three defining relations are satisfied. For example, we know that \(r^{2n} = e\). So we want \(\phi(r^{2n}) = \phi(e) = [0]\). But this is also</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(r^{2n}) = 2n\phi(r) = [2n]_2 = 0.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Similarly, we have \(\phi(s^2) = \phi(e) = [0]\) and at the same time</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(s^2) = \phi(ss) = \phi(s)+\phi(s) = 0
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Finally, we have \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{n-1})\). We can check both sides</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(rs) &amp;= \phi(r) + \phi(s) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\
	\phi(sr^{2n-1}) &amp;= 0 + 2n-1 = [2n-1]_2 = 1
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So \(\phi\) is a homomorphism. It is surjective since we hit both elements in the target. Next we’ll calculate the kernel.</p>
<div>
	$$

We have the identities: $$ \begin{align*} i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, \quad ij = k, \quad ji = -k, \quad ijk = -1 \end{align*} $$ \(ij = k\) is going in a clockwise direction while \(ji = -k\) is going in a counter clockwise direction. TODO: Group diagram. There are three cyclic subgroups of order 4: \(\langle i \rangle\), \(\langle j \rangle\) and \(\langle k \rangle\). There is one cyclic group of order 2: \(\langle -1 \rangle\). Note that \(\langle i \rangle = \{1, i, -1, -i\}\). Let’s find the cosets of \(\langle i \rangle\) in \(Q_8\). $$ \begin{align*} j\langle i \rangle &amp;= j\{1, i, -1, -i\} = \{j, -k, -j, k\} \\ \langle i \rangle j &amp;= \{1, i, -1, -i\}j = \{j, k, -j, -k\} \end{align*} $$ Note that \(Q_8\) is generated by two elements \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (easy to check). Therefore, since \(j\langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle j\) and we checked all the generators of the group, then \(\langle i \rangle\) is a normal subgroup. Let’s study the quotient group \(Q_8 / \langle i \rangle\). We know that it must contain two elements (By Lagrange’s Theorem). $$ \begin{align*} Q_8 / \langle i \rangle = \{\langle i \rangle, j \langle i \rangle\} \end{align*} $$ Recall, that we defined the multiplication of cosets by \((xN)(yN)=(xy)N\). Since we have two elements, observe that \(\langle i \rangle \langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle\). Multiply \(j \langle i \rangle\) by \(\langle i \rangle\) is just \(j \langle i \rangle\). Remember that \(\langle i \rangle\) acts as the identity element/coset here. So the only interesting product is \((j\langle i \rangle) (j\langle i \rangle)\) [TODO: add a table] $$ \begin{align*} (j\langle i \rangle) (j\langle i \rangle) &amp;= j^2 \langle i \rangle = -\langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle. \end{align*} $$ This multiplication table looks like the multiplication table of \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). In fact \(Q_8 / \langle i \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\). Example 2 Taking \(Q_8\) from before, let’s look at at the cyclic group generated by \(\langle -1 \rangle\). $$ \begin{align*} \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-1, 1\} \end{align*} $$ \(\langle -1 \rangle\) is a normal subgroup (easy check, every element in the subgroup commutes with all elements in \(Q_8\)). So we now look at the quotient structure. (the cosets of \(\langle -1 \rangle\) in \(Q_8\)) $$ \begin{align*} i \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-i, i\} \\ j \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-j, j\} \\ k \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-k, k\} \\ Q_8 / \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{i \langle -1 \rangle , i \langle -1 \rangle, j \langle -1 \rangle, k \langle -1 \rangle \} \end{align*} $$ Let’s calculate the order of each element. For example, \((i \langle -1 \rangle)^2 = -1\langle -1 \rangle = \langle -1 \rangle\). So \(o(i\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\). In fact, we also have \(o(j\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\) and \(o(k\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\). This isn’t cyclic so this group must be isomorphic to the non-cyclic group of order 4. So it’s isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_2\). Example 3 Suppose that we are given $$ \begin{align*} \phi: \mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n \\ &amp;\phi(m) = [m] = \{k \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ k \equiv m (\bmod n)\} \end{align*} $$ We want to show that \(\phi(m)\) is surjective. This is because for all \(0 \leq m \leq m - 1\), \(\phi(m) = [m]\) So we are able to hit every value of \(m\). It is also a homomorphism. since $$ \begin{align*} \phi(m_1 + m_2) = [m_1 + m_2] = [m_1] + [m_2] = \phi(m_1) + \phi(m_2) \end{align*} $$ The kernel of \(\phi\) is $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ m \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ [m] = [0]\} \\ &amp;= \{0, \pm n, \pm 2n,....\} = n\mathbf{Z} \end{align*} $$ So now we have \(\ker(\phi) = n\mathbf{Z}\). We know that it is normal. We also showed that \(\phi\) is a surjective homomorphism. Therefore, by the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}/n\mathbf{Z} \cong \mathbf{Z}_n\). Example 4 Next, let’s take $$ \begin{align*} \phi: \mathbf{Z}_4 &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\ &amp;\phi([m]_4) = [m]_2 \end{align*} $$ Here, it is not obvious this is well-defined. So let’s check that it is. Suppose that \([m_1]_4 = [m_2]_4\). We want to show that \(\phi([m_1]_4) = \phi([m_2]_4)\). Observe that $$ \begin{align*} [m_1]_4 &amp;= [m_2]_4 \\ [m_1]_4 - [m_2]_4 &amp;= [0]_4 \\ [m_1 - m_2]_4 &amp;= [0]_4 \\ m_1-m_2 &amp;\equiv 0 \bmod 4 \end{align*} $$ This says that \(m_1 - m_2\) must be a multiple of 4 so \(m_1 - m_2 = 4k = 2(2k)\) for some \(k \in \mathbf{Z}\). So \(m_1 - m_2\) is also a multiple of 2. Therefore, \(m_1-m_2 \equiv 0 \bmod 2\) and so \([m_1]_2 = [m_2]_2\). \(\phi\) is also a homomorphism. since $$ \begin{align*} \phi([m_1]_4 + [m_2]_4) = \phi([m_1 + m_2]_4) = [m_1 + m_2]_2 = [m_1]_2 + [m_2]_2 = \phi(m_1) + \phi(m_2). \end{align*} $$ Next we want to show that \(\phi\) is surjective. Notice that there are two values in the target domain. \([0]_2\) and \([1]_2\). Also note that \(\phi([0]_4) = [0]_2\) and \(\phi([1]_4) = [1]_2\) so it is surjective. The kernel of \(\phi\) is $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ [m]_4 \in \mathbf{Z}_4 \ | \ \phi([m]_4) = [0]_2\} \\ &amp;= \{ [m]_4 \in \mathbf{Z}_4 \ | \ [m]_2 = [0]_2\} \\ &amp;= \{ [0]_4, [2]_4 \} = \langle [2]_4 \rangle = 2\mathbf{Z}_4 \\ \end{align*} $$ So now we have \(\ker(\phi) = \langle [2]_4 \rangle\). We know that it is normal. We also showed that \(\phi\) is a surjective homomorphism. Therefore, by the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}_4/\langle [2]_4 \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\). Example 5 Next, let’s take $$ \begin{align*} \phi: \mathbf{Z}_6 &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_{15} \end{align*} $$ We need to figure out a homomorphism. First recall that for any element, \(|\phi(x)| \ | \ |x|\). Let’s list the order of the elements in \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\). Notice here that \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\) is a cyclic group (with addition) so the order of any element \(g + a\) is going to be \(\frac{15}{gcd(a,15)}\) $$ \begin{align*} &amp;o(1): [0]_{15} \\ &amp;o(3): [5]_{15}, [10]_{15} \\ &amp;o(5): [3]_{15}, [6]_{15}, [9]_{15}, [12]_{15} \\ &amp;o(15): [1]_{15}, [2]_{15}, [4]_{15}, [7]_{15}, [11]_{15}, [13]_{15}, [14]_{15} \\ \end{align*} $$ So now let’s pick \([1]_{6}\). It is a generator for \(\mathbf{Z}_{6}\). We know that \(\phi([1]_6)\) must divide the order of the element itself so \(|[1]_6| = 6\). So that tells us that \(|\phi([1]_6)|\) must be either 1,2,3 or 6. 2 and 6 are not possibilities so we don’t have any elements of that order in \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\). So it’s either 1 or 3. Case 1: Suppose we pick some element of order 1. That means that \(\phi([1]_6) = 1\). This implies that \(\phi([1]_6) = [0]_{15}\). Since it’s a generator, then \(\ker(\phi) = \mathbf{Z}_6\). And \(Im(\phi) = \{[0]_{15}\}\). This gives us \(\mathbf{Z}_6/\mathbf{Z}_6 = \{[0]_{15}\} \leq \mathbf{Z}_{15}\). So it’s pretty boring. Case 2: Suppose we pick some element of order 3 so \(|\phi([1]_6)| = 3\). So let \(\phi([1]_6) = [5]_{15}\). Based on this, where will \([2]_6\) will go? Remember that we want \(\phi\) to be a homomorphism. This means that we want this to be true. That \(\phi([2]_6) = \phi([1 + 1]_6) = \phi([1]_6) + \phi([1]_6) = [5]_{15} + [5_{15} = [10]_{15}\). So we want to pick \([10]_{15}\) for \([2]_6\). Based on this, the elements will get mapped to $$ \begin{align*} [0]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [0]_{15} \\ [1]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [5]_{15} \\ [2]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [10]_{15} \\ [3]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [0]_{15} \\ [4]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [5]_{15} \\ [5]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [10]_{15}. \end{align*} $$ So the image of our homomorphism is $$ \begin{align*} Im(\phi) = \{[0]_{15}, [5]_{15}, [10]_{15}\} = \langle [5]_{15} \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_3 \end{align*} $$ The last statement is because all cyclic groups of order 3 are isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_3\). The kernel of \(\phi\) is $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ [m]_6 \in \mathbf{Z}_6 \ | \ \phi([m]_6) = [0]_{15}\} \\ &amp;= \{ [0]_6, [3]_{6} \} = \langle [3]_6 \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\\ \end{align*} $$ By the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}_{6}/\langle [3]_6 \rangle \cong \langle [5]_{15} \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_3\). Example 6 Next, let’s take $$ \begin{align*} D_n = \langle r,s \ | \ r^n = s^2 = e, rs = sr^{n-1} \rangle \end{align*} $$ To define a homomorphism, we need these defining identities to hold on both sides. So let’s define $$ \begin{align*} \phi: D_n &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\ r &amp;\rightarrow 0 \quad \text{we don't to write $[0]_2$ since it's clear} \\ s &amp;\rightarrow 1 \end{align*} $$ So now we need to verify that the three defining relations are satisfied. For example, we know that \(r^n = e\). So we want \(\phi(r^n) = \phi(e) = [0]\). But this is also $$ \begin{align*} \phi(r^n) = \phi(rr...r) = \phi(r)+...\phi(r) = 0+...+0 = 0. \end{align*} $$ Similarly, we have \(\phi(s^2) = \phi(e) = [0]\) and at the same time $$ \begin{align*} \phi(s^2) = \phi(ss) = \phi(s)+\phi(s) = 1 + 1 = 0 \end{align*} $$ Finally, we have \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{n-1})\). We can check both sides $$ \begin{align*} \phi(rs) &amp;= \phi(r) + \phi(s) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\ \phi(sr^{n-1}) &amp;= \phi(s) + \phi(r) + ... + \phi(r) = 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1 \end{align*} $$ Next, we need to see that it is surjective but that’s trivial since we’re sending \(r\) to \(0\) and \(s\) to \(1\) so it’s definitely surjective. The image of \(\phi\) is \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). The kernel is also easy to see $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ l \in D_n \ | \ \phi(l) = 0\} \\ &amp;= \langle r \rangle \\ \end{align*} $$ This is because any rotation is sent to 0 and any reflection \(\phi(r^ks) = \phi(sr^{n-k} = 1\). By the Isomorphism Theorem, \(D_n/\langle r \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\). Example 7 Let’s continue with the dihedral group and suppose we have $$ \begin{align*} D_n = \langle r,s \ | \ r^n = s^2 = e, rs = sr^{n-1} \rangle \end{align*} $$ To define a homomorphism, we need these defining identities to hold on both sides. So let’s define $$ \begin{align*} \phi: D_n &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n \\ r &amp;\rightarrow 1 \\ s &amp;\rightarrow 0 \end{align*} $$ Is this a homomorphism? Let’s check the identity \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{n-1})\). We can check both sides $$ \begin{align*} \phi(rs) &amp;= \phi(r) + \phi(s) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\ \phi(sr^{n-1}) &amp;= \phi(s) + (\phi(r) + ... + \phi(r)) = 0 + n - 1 = n - 1. \end{align*} $$ Note that \(1 \not\equiv n - 1 \bmod n\) unless \(n = 2\). So it’s not a homomorphism for any \(n &gt; 2\). Example 8 Let’s take another dihedral group example. Define $$ \begin{align*} D_{2n} = \langle r,s \ | \ r^{2n} = s^2 = e, rs = sr^{2n-1} \rangle \end{align*} $$ And then define $$ \begin{align*} \phi: D_{2n} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\ r &amp;\rightarrow 1 \\ s &amp;\rightarrow 0 \end{align*} $$ We need to verify that the three defining relations are satisfied. For example, we know that \(r^{2n} = e\). So we want \(\phi(r^{2n}) = \phi(e) = [0]\). But this is also $$ \begin{align*} \phi(r^{2n}) = 2n\phi(r) = [2n]_2 = 0. \end{align*} $$ Similarly, we have \(\phi(s^2) = \phi(e) = [0]\) and at the same time $$ \begin{align*} \phi(s^2) = \phi(ss) = \phi(s)+\phi(s) = 0 \end{align*} $$ Finally, we have \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{n-1})\). We can check both sides $$ \begin{align*} \phi(rs) &amp;= \phi(r) + \phi(s) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\ \phi(sr^{2n-1}) &amp;= 0 + 2n-1 = [2n-1]_2 = 1 \end{align*} $$ So \(\phi\) is a homomorphism. It is surjective since we hit both elements in the target. Next we’ll calculate the kernel. $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ l \in D_n \ | \ \phi(l) = [0]_2\} \\ &amp;= \{e, r^2, r^4 ... r^{2n-2}, s, sr^2 ... sr^{2n-2} \} \\ &amp;= \langle s, r^2 \rangle \leq D_{2n}\\ &amp;= \langle s, r^2 \ | \ s^2=(r^2)^{n} = e, r^2s = s(r^2)^{n-1} \rangle \cong D_n \end{align*} $$ By the Isomorphism Theorem, \(D_{2n}/D_n \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\). Example 11 Suppose now we have the following map $$ \begin{align*} \phi: D_{6} &amp;\rightarrow S_6 \\ r &amp;\rightarrow (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6) \\ s &amp;\rightarrow (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) \end{align*} $$ This is easy to see if we draw a hexagon and label the vertices as follows So we can see that a reflection about the \(y\) axis is represented by the above map. So now we want to check if \(\phi\) defines a homomorphism. We do this by checking the defining relations in \(D_6\) So we want \(\phi(r^6) = \phi(e) = (1) = e_{S_6}\). But this is also $$ \begin{align*} \phi(r^6) = (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)^6 = e \end{align*} $$ Similarly, we have \(\phi(s^2) = \phi(e) = [0]\) and it easy to check that we do get \(\phi(s^2) = e\). Finally, we have \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{5})\). We can check both sides $$ \begin{align*} \phi(rs) &amp;= (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6) (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) = (1)(2 \ 6)(3 \ 5)(4) = (2 \ 6)(3 \ 5) \\ \phi(sr^{n-1}) &amp;= (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)^5 \\ &amp;= (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) (1 \ 6 \ 5 \ 4 \ 3 \ 2) \quad \text{(we can count by 5)} \\ &amp;= (1)(2 \ 6)(3 \ 5)(4) = (2 \ 6)(3 \ 5) \end{align*} $$ The image of \(\phi\) is going to be generating by \((1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)\) and \((1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4)\) $$ \begin{align*} im(\phi) &amp;= \langle (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6), (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) \rangle \\ \end{align*} $$ We claim that the kernel only contains the identity. Why? note that \(|r| = 6\) and the order of its image is \(|(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)|\). This tells us $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ l \in D_n \ | \ \phi(l) = 0\} \\ &amp;= \langle r \rangle \\ \end{align*} $$ References The order of an element in a direct group is the lcm of both elements orders Isomorphism Examples]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Study Notes: Extra Proofs …</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/14/math417-extra-proofs.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Study Notes: Extra Proofs …" /><published>2025-02-14T00:01:36-08:00</published><updated>2025-02-14T00:01:36-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/14/math417-extra-proofs</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/14/math417-extra-proofs.html"><![CDATA[<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>

Suppose \((x,y) \in G_1 \times G_2\) and that the order of the elements are \(|x| = r\) and \(|y| = s\). Then the order of \((x,y)\) is \(lcm(r,s)\)

Let \(l = lcm(r,s)\). Then, \(l = ra = sb\) for some \(r, b \in \mathbf{Z}\). Observe that</p>

\(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n \cong \mathbf{Z}_{mn}\) if and only if \(gcd(m,n) = 1\)

<p><br />
This says if you take the product of two cyclic groups, then their product is cyclic if and only if \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime.
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
\(\longrightarrow:\) Suppose \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n \cong \mathbf{Z}_{mn}\). Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(gcd(m,n) = d &gt; 1\). Now, take an arbitrary element \((a,b) \in \mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\). Add \((a,b)+...+(a,b)\) \(\frac{mn}{d}\) times. We will see that</p>
<div>

	\begin{align*}
	(a\frac{mn}{d},b\frac{mn}{d}) &amp;= (a\frac{n}{d}m,b\frac{m}{d}n) \\

</div>
<p>Notice here that both \(\frac{n}{d}\) and \(\frac{m}{d}\) are whole numbers since \(d\) is a divisor of both \(m\) and \(n\). So the first entry is a multiple of \(m\) while the second entry is a multiple of \(n\). This implies that the order of \((a,b) \leq \frac{mn}{d} &lt; mn\). So the order of any element \((a,b) \in \mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\) is strictly less than \(mn\). This means that no element of \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\) can be a generator of the group. So \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\) is not cyclic. This is a contradiction because \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\) isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_{mn}\) and so it is cyclic. 
<br />
<br />
\(\longleftarrow:\) Now suppose that \(gcd(m,n) = 1\). We want to show that \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_{mn}\). Notice that the order of the element 1 has order \(m\) in \(\mathbf{Z}_m\) and the order of the element 1 has order \(n\) in \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). This tells us that the order of \((1,1) = lcm(m,n) \frac{mn}{gcd(m,n)} \frac{mn}{1} = mn\). So \((1,1)\) has order \(mn\) which means it generates the group. So it must be cyclic. So \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n = \langle (1,1) \rangle\). We know all cyclic groups that have the same order are isomorphic. So \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n \cong \mathbf{Z}_{mn}\).

Then the order of \((x,y)\) is \(lcm(r,s)\) Proof Let \(l = lcm(r,s)\). Then, \(l = ra = sb\) for some \(r, b \in \mathbf{Z}\). Observe that $$ \begin{align*} (x,y)^{l} &amp;= (x^l, y^l) = (x^{ra}, y^{sb}) = (e_1, e_2) \end{align*} $$ From this we see that the order of \((x,y)\) must divide \(l\). If we let \(l' = |(x,y)|\), then \(l' \ | \ l\). Now, observe that $$ \begin{align*} (x,y)^{l'} &amp;= (x^{l'}, y^{l'}) = (e_1, e_2) \end{align*} $$ But since \(|x| = r\) and \(|y| = s\), then \(r \ | \ l'\) and \(s \ | \ l'\).

Why is that? When we previously discussed classifying finite groups, we wanted to classify the groups of a certain finite order up to an isomorphism. We asked the question “what are the groups up to isomorphism that are of order 6 for example?” This is a hard question in general. However, if we restricted the domain to only finite abelian groups, it turns out that it is a much easier task to describe and classify the groups that are finite abelian up to isomorphism for any order. Though it will require a lot of hard work to prove these classifications. 
<br />
<br />
We’ll start with this important fact: <br />
<b>Key Fact</b>: Every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a finite product of finite cyclic groups.</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		G \cong \mathbf{Z}_{n_1} \times \mathbf{Z}_{n_2} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}_{n_k}, \quad k \geq 0,n_1,...,n_k \geq 1
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>(Side Note: How do you factor the trivial group? (you can think of it as a group with no factors)). So this fact doesn’t lead to a classification. This can be problematic if we have multiple ways to factor this. Meaning that \(G\) could be isomorphic in more than one way? Recall that the Chinese Remainder Theorem states that
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem (CRT)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
if \(a = a_1a_2...,a_k\) where \(a_1,...,a_k\) are relatively prime and \(a_i \geq 1\). Then
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\mathbf{Z}_a \cong \mathbf{Z}_{a_1} \times ...\times \mathbf{Z}_{a_k}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
For example, \(\mathbf{Z}_{60} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{4} \times \mathbf{Z}_{15} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{4} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3} \times \mathbf{Z}_{5}\). But this doesn’t help with classification. For example, if we’re given some other product of cyclic groups, how do we know it’s isomorphic to a given group? A classification means that we can look at two products of cyclic groups and then be able to know if they are isomorphic to each other or not.
<br />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Elementary Divisor Classification</b></h4>
<p>As a start we have the following classification theorem
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem (Elementary Divisors)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Every finite abelian group \(G\) is isomorphic to a group of the following form
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	G \cong \mathbf{Z}_{p_1^{r_1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{p_2^{r_2}}\times ...\times \mathbf{Z}_{p_k^{r_k}}
	\end{align*}
	$$
where \(k \geq 0, r_1 \geq 1, p_1,p_2,...,p_k\) are primes. (not necessarily distinct)
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the list \(p_1^{r_1}, p_2^{r_2}, ..., p_k^{r_k}\) of elementary divisors is unique up to re-ordering.
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
So \(G\) is isomorphic to only one direct product of cyclic prime orders (up to re-ordering). This means that if \(G\) is isomorphic to a direct products of prime orders and it’s also isomorphic to another direct products of prime orders. Then, the prime numbers must be exactly the same up to re-ordering. 
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Example. Suppose \(|G| = 24\) and that \(G\) is abelian. 24 has the prime factorization \(24 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3\). Thus, \(G\) is isomorphic to one of the following</p>
<ol>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{3}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}}\). Note here that this group is cyclic by the Chinese Remainder Theorem since \(8\) and \(3\) are relatively prime.</li>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{2}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \)</li>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}}\)</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Invariant Factor Classification</b></h4>
<p>We have another classification Theorem. 
<br /></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem (Invariant Factor Form)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Every finite abelian group \(G\) is isomorphic to a group of the following form
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	G \cong \mathbf{Z}_{a_1} \times \mathbf{Z}_{a_2} ...\times \mathbf{Z}_{a_s}
	\end{align*}
	$$
where \(s \geq 0, a_1 \geq 2\) and \(a_i \ | \ a_{i+1}\).
<br />
Furthermore, the list \(a_1, a_2,...,a_s\) of "Invariant Factors" is unique.
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Note that we don’t need to add up to re-ordering here since the condition \(a_i \ | \ a_{i+1}\) forces it to be in one particular unique order.
<br />
<br />
Example: If we take the same \(G\) as before where \(|G|=24\), then we \(G\) is isomorphic to one of the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}_{24}\).</li>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{12}\). Note how each factor divides the factor coming after it. </li>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{6}\). Same here 2 divides 2 and then the next 2 divides 6</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice how this theorem gave us three possibilities and the previous theorem gave us another three possibilities. In fact, there is a correspondance between the elementary divisors and the invariant factors.</p>
<ol>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{3}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{24}\).</li>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{2}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{12}\). </li>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{6}\).</li>
</ol>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>We will prove both theorems later but the idea is that we’re going to prove the existence of invariant factors first and then we’re going to prove the uniqueness of the elementary divisors. This is enough because if we have an invariant factor decomposition, then we can always turn it into its elementary divisors decomposition. To see, we’ll do an example next.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Suppose \(G\) is finite abelian with invariant factors: \(5,25,50,36000\). So \(G\) is isomorphic to</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		G \cong \mathbf{Z}_{5} \times \mathbf{Z}_{25} \times \mathbf{Z}_{50} \times \mathbf{Z}_{36000}
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>Now, we can take each of these invariant factors and factor into primes.</p>

		<td>36000</td>
		<td>\(2^5\)</td>

	</tr>

<p>This in fact gives us the elementary divisors. How? Observe that</p>
<table style="max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto;">

		<td>\(\mathbf{Z}_{36000} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{2^5} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{5^3}\) (By CRT)</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The first column is the invariant factors while the next three are the elementary divisors. We can also start with the elementary divisors and then get the invariant factors from them. So suppose \(G\) has elementary divisors:</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		2^1, 2^3, 3^2, 5^1, 5^2, 5^2, 5^3
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>We can recover the invariant factors by stacking the highest powers of divisors at the bottom. So in the following table. \(5^3\) is the at the bottom of the column, then we have \(5^2\) and then \(5^2\) and so on. After stacking all the divisors, we can multiply the divisors in each row to get the actual list of invariant factors.</p>

		<td>\(3^2\)</td>
		<td>\(5^3\)</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Elementary Divisor Classification Proof Plan</b></h4>
<p>We have two aspects. Existence and Uniqueness. We will show uniqueness first. We want to show if</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align}
		G &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}_{p_1^{r_1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{p_2^{r_2}} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}_{p_k^{r_k}}, \quad \text{and} \\ 
		G &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}_{q_1^{s_1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{q_2^{s_2}} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}_{q_l^{s_l}}, 
		\end{align}
		$$
</div>
<p>then the lists \(p_1^{r_1},...,p_k^{r_k}\) and \(q_1^{s_1},...,q_l^{s_l}\) are the same up to reordering. So lists like \(2^1,3^3,3^3,5^4\) and \(3^3,2^1,5^4,3^3\) ar the same. But we know that if \(G\) is isomorphic to both products, then both products are isomorphism to each other. So we really just want to show</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		&amp;\mathbf{Z}_{p_1^{r_1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{p_2^{r_2}} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}_{p_k^{r_k}}, \quad \text{and} \\ 
		&amp;\mathbf{Z}_{q_1^{s_1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{q_2^{s_2}} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}_{q_l^{s_l}}, 
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>and we don’t have to worry about \(G\). Now, we’ve seen before that if two groups are isomorphic, then the order of the elements in both groups must match up. We can’t use this fact to prove that two groups are isomorphic (though it can give us a clue). However, we can use it to show that groups are not isomorphic. So if they the orders don’t match up, then we can conclude that the given groups are not isomorphic. So the plan here is to count the orders of the elements in both of the products and if the numbers don’t match up, then these products are different. Though, we’re not going to use the order directly as the formula gets too complicated. We’ll use something slightly different, defined as follows

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Three Properties of \(\alpha_m(G)\)</b></h4>
<p>We’ll prove three important properties about the function \(\alpha_m(G)\).
<br /></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 1
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(G\) and \(H\) are finite groups and if \(G \cong H\), then \(\alpha_m(G) = \alpha_m(H)\)
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
We say that \(\alpha_m\) is an isomorphism invariant of finite groups. Recall that \(\alpha_m\) is the number of elements that are the identity when raised to the power \(m\). So this says if \(G\) and \(H\) isomorphic, then they’ll have the same number of those elements. This makes sense since we know if they are isomorphic, then each group will have the same number of elements of each order. The orders must match.
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Let \(\phi: G \rightarrow H\) be an isomorphism. We claim that \(\phi\) restricts to a bijection \(G[m] \rightarrow H[m]\). This would immediately apply that \(\alpha_m(G) = \alpha_m(H)\).
<br />
<br />
\(\phi\) restricts to a function</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		G[m] \rightarrow H[m] \\
		g \rightarrow \phi(g)
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>We want to show that if \(g \in G[m]\), then \(\phi(g) \in H[m]\). Suppose that \(g^m = e\). Observe that</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		\phi(g)^m &amp;= \phi(g^m) \quad \text{(because $\phi$ is a homomorphism)} \\
		          &amp;= \phi(e_g) \quad \text{(by the assumption)} \\
				  &amp;= e_H
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>Therefore, \(\phi(g) \in H[m]\). Now, since \(\phi\) is an isomorphism, then the inverse function \(\phi^{-1}: H \rightarrow G\) is also an isomorphism. We can use a similar argument to show that \(\phi^{-1}\) restricts to a function</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		H[m] \rightarrow G[m]
		x \rightarrow \phi^{-1}(x)
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>Therefore, the restricted function \(G[m] \rightarrow H[m]\) is a bijection. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(G = G_1 \times G_2 \times ... \times G_k\) where \(G_i\) is a finite group, then 
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\alpha_m(G) = \alpha_m(G_1) \cdot \alpha_m(G_2) \ \cdot \ ... \ \cdot \ \alpha_m(G_k)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
Since now we have a direct product, then</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		G[m]: \{(g_1,g_2,...,g_k), g_i \in G_i \ | \ (g_1,g_2,...,g_k)^m = (e,e,...,e) \} 
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>But we know that multiplication in a direct product is component wise so \((g_1,g_2,...,g_k)^m = (g_1^m,g_2^m,...,g_k^m)\). This implies that \(g_1 \in G_1[m]\) if \(g_1^m = e\) and so on for each component. Therefore, we can write \(G[m] = G_1[m] \times ... \times G_k[m]\). The size of this set is \(|G_1[m]| \times ... |G_k[m]|\) which is what we wanted to show.

So when the group is cyclic, then the number of elements which become the identity when raised to the power \(m\) is exactly \(d\) where \(d\) is the gcd of \(m\) and \(n = |G|\).
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Step (1): We will show that if \(G\) is a group (even if not cyclic) such that \(|G| = n\), then \(\alpha_m(G) = \alpha_d(G)\) where \(d = gcd(m,n)\). In fact, not only do \(G[m]\) and \(G[d]\) have the same size, we will show that they are exactly the same subset so \(G[m] = G[d]\). Recall that</p>
<div>
 		$$
 		\begin{align*}
 		G[m]: \{g \in G \ | \ g^m = e \} \\
		 G[d]: \{g \in G \ | \ g^d = e \} \\
 		\end{align*}
 		$$
 </div>
<p>\(G[d] \subseteq G[m]\):
Since \(d = gcd(m,n)\), then \(d \ | \ m\) and \(m = ds\) for some \(s \in \mathbf{Z}\). Suppose that \(g^d = e\), then</p>
<div>
 		$$
 		\begin{align*}
 		g^m = g^{ds} = (g^d)^s = e^s = e.
 		\end{align*}
 		$$
 </div>
<p><br />
<br />
\(G[m] \subseteq G[d]\): We can also write \(d\) as \(d = sm + tn\) for some \(t, n \in \mathbf{Z}\). Since \(|G| = n\), then we know that \(g^n = e\) for any \(g \in G\) by the order theorem. So suppose that \(g^m = e\), then</p>
<div>
 		$$
 		\begin{align*}
 		g^d = g^{sm + tn} = g^{sm} g^{tn} = (g^m)^s (g^n)^t = e.
 		\end{align*}
 		$$
 </div>
<p>So \(G[m] \subseteq G[d]\). Therefore, \(G[m] = G[d]\) and therefore \(\alpha_m(G) = \alpha_d(G)\).
<br />
<br />
Step (2): We will show that if \(d \ | \ n\), then \(\alpha_d(\mathbf{Z}_n) = d\). We can calculate this. We know</p>
<div>
 		$$
 		\begin{align*}
 		\mathbf{Z}_n = \{[1]_n, [2]_n,...,[n]_n\}
 		\end{align*}
 		$$
 </div>
<p>If \(1 \leq k \leq n\), then \(o([k]_n) = gcd(k,n)\). (we proved this before). We can use this to show that</p>
<div>
 		$$
 		\begin{align*}
 		\mathbf{Z}_n[d] = \{[e]_n, [2w]_n,...,[de]_n\}
 		\end{align*}
 		$$

<h4><b>Combining Everything</b></h4>
<p>So now we have three propositions about \(\alpha_m[G]\)</p>

	<li>If \(G \cong H\), then \(\alpha_m(G) = \alpha_m(H)\)</li>
	<li>If \(G = G_1 \times G_2 \times ... \times G_k\) then \(\alpha_m(G) = \alpha_m(G_1) \cdot \alpha_m(G_2) \ \cdot \ ... \ \cdot \ \alpha_m(G_k)\)</li>
	<li>If \(p, q\) are primes where \(p \neq q\), then \(\alpha_{q^l}(\mathbf{Z}_{p^r}) = 1\) (Corollary from proposition 3 since the gcd will be 1). Furthermore, \(\alpha_{p^l}(\mathbf{Z}_{p^r}) = min(p^l, p^r)\). Note here that the gcd of \(p^l, p^r\) is exactly their minimum.</li>

<p>This here proves the uniqueness of elementary divisors. Why? if \(G\) is isomorphic to two products of elementary divisors. The function \(\beta_{q^l}\) gives us exactly the number of elementary divisors that are equal to \({q^l}\) in the given product. \(\beta\) is an isomorphism invariant. So if we’re given different products, \(\beta\) will give different numbers and the products can’t be isomorphic.

Why is that? When we previously discussed classifying finite groups, we wanted to classify the groups of a certain finite order up to an isomorphism. We asked the question “what are the groups up to isomorphism that are of order 6 for example?” This is a hard question in general. However, if we restricted the domain to only finite abelian groups, it turns out that it is a much easier task to describe and classify the groups that are finite abelian up to isomorphism for any order. Though it will require a lot of hard work to prove these classifications. We’ll start with this important fact: Key Fact: Every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a finite product of finite cyclic groups. $$ \begin{align*} G \cong \mathbf{Z}_{n_1} \times \mathbf{Z}_{n_2} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}_{n_k}, \quad k \geq 0,n_1,...,n_k \geq 1 \end{align*} $$ (Side Note: How do you factor the trivial group? (you can think of it as a group with no factors)). So this fact doesn’t lead to a classification. This can be problematic if we have multiple ways to factor this. Meaning that \(G\) could be isomorphic in more than one way? Recall that the Chinese Remainder Theorem states that Theorem (CRT) if \(a = a_1a_2...,a_k\) where \(a_1,...,a_k\) are relatively prime and \(a_i \geq 1\). Then $$ \begin{align*} \mathbf{Z}_a \cong \mathbf{Z}_{a_1} \times ...\times \mathbf{Z}_{a_k} \end{align*} $$ For example, \(\mathbf{Z}_{60} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{4} \times \mathbf{Z}_{15} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{4} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3} \times \mathbf{Z}_{5}\). But this doesn’t help with classification. For example, if we’re given some other product of cyclic groups, how do we know it’s isomorphic to a given group? A classification means that we can look at two products of cyclic groups and then be able to know if they are isomorphic to each other or not. Elementary Divisor Classification As a start we have the following classification theorem Theorem (Elementary Divisors) Every finite abelian group \(G\) is isomorphic to a group of the following form $$ \begin{align*} G \cong \mathbf{Z}_{p_1^{r_1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{p_2^{r_2}}\times ...\times \mathbf{Z}_{p_k^{r_k}} \end{align*} $$ where \(k \geq 0, r_1 \geq 1, p_1,p_2,...,p_k\) are primes. (not necessarily distinct) Furthermore, the list \(p_1^{r_1}, p_2^{r_2}, ..., p_k^{r_k}\) of elementary divisors is unique up to re-ordering. So \(G\) is isomorphic to only one direct product of cyclic prime orders (up to re-ordering). This means that if \(G\) is isomorphic to a direct products of prime orders and it’s also isomorphic to another direct products of prime orders. Then, the prime numbers must be exactly the same up to re-ordering. Example. Suppose \(|G| = 24\) and that \(G\) is abelian. 24 has the prime factorization \(24 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3\). Thus, \(G\) is isomorphic to one of the following \(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{3}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}}\). Note here that this group is cyclic by the Chinese Remainder Theorem since \(8\) and \(3\) are relatively prime. \(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{2}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \) \(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}}\) Invariant Factor Classification We have another classification Theorem. Theorem (Invariant Factor Form) Every finite abelian group \(G\) is isomorphic to a group of the following form $$ \begin{align*} G \cong \mathbf{Z}_{a_1} \times \mathbf{Z}_{a_2} ...\times \mathbf{Z}_{a_s} \end{align*} $$ where \(s \geq 0, a_1 \geq 2\) and \(a_i \ | \ a_{i+1}\). Furthermore, the list \(a_1, a_2,...,a_s\) of "Invariant Factors" is unique. Note that we don’t need to add up to re-ordering here since the condition \(a_i \ | \ a_{i+1}\) forces it to be in one particular unique order. Example: If we take the same \(G\) as before where \(|G|=24\), then we \(G\) is isomorphic to one of the following: \(\mathbf{Z}_{24}\). \(\mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{12}\). Note how each factor divides the factor coming after it. \(\mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{6}\). Same here 2 divides 2 and then the next 2 divides 6 Notice how this theorem gave us three possibilities and the previous theorem gave us another three possibilities. In fact, there is a correspondance between the elementary divisors and the invariant factors. \(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{3}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{24}\). \(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{2}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{12}\). \(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{6}\). We will prove both theorems later but the idea is that we’re going to prove the existence of invariant factors first and then we’re going to prove the uniqueness of the elementary divisors. This is enough because if we have an invariant factor decomposition, then we can always turn it into its elementary divisors decomposition. To see, we’ll do an example next. Example Suppose \(G\) is finite abelian with invariant factors: \(5,25,50,36000\). So \(G\) is isomorphic to $$ \begin{align*} G \cong \mathbf{Z}_{5} \times \mathbf{Z}_{25} \times \mathbf{Z}_{50} \times \mathbf{Z}_{36000} \end{align*} $$ Now, we can take each of these invariant factors and factor into primes. 5 \(5^1\) 25 \(5^2\) 50 \(2^1\) \(5^2\) 36000 \(2^5\) \(3^2\) \(5^3\) This in fact gives us the elementary divisors. How? Observe that 5 \(5^1\) \(\mathbf{Z}_5 \cong \mathbf{Z}_5\) 25 \(5^2\) \(\mathbf{Z}_{25} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{5^2}\) 50 \(2^1\) \(5^2\) \(\mathbf{Z}_{50} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{5^2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^1} \) (By CRT) 36000 \(2^5\) \(3^2\) \(5^3\) \(\mathbf{Z}_{36000} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{2^5} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{5^3}\) (By CRT) The first column is the invariant factors while the next three are the elementary divisors. We can also start with the elementary divisors and then get the invariant factors from them. So suppose \(G\) has elementary divisors: $$ \begin{align*} 2^1, 2^3, 3^2, 5^1, 5^2, 5^2, 5^3 \end{align*} $$ We can recover the invariant factors by stacking the highest powers of divisors at the bottom. So in the following table. \(5^3\) is the at the bottom of the column, then we have \(5^2\) and then \(5^2\) and so on. After stacking all the divisors, we can multiply the divisors in each row to get the actual list of invariant factors. 5 \(5^1\) 25 \(5^2\) 50 \(2^1\) \(5^2\) 36000 \(2^3\) \(3^2\) \(5^3\) Elementary Divisor Classification Proof Plan We have two aspects. Existence and Uniqueness. We will show uniqueness first. We want to show if $$ \begin{align} G &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}_{p_1^{r_1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{p_2^{r_2}} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}_{p_k^{r_k}}, \quad \text{and} \\ G &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}_{q_1^{s_1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{q_2^{s_2}} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}_{q_l^{s_l}}, \end{align} $$ then the lists \(p_1^{r_1},...,p_k^{r_k}\) and \(q_1^{s_1},...,q_l^{s_l}\) are the same up to reordering. So lists like \(2^1,3^3,3^3,5^4\) and \(3^3,2^1,5^4,3^3\) ar the same. But we know that if \(G\) is isomorphic to both products, then both products are isomorphism to each other. So we really just want to show $$ \begin{align*} &amp;\mathbf{Z}_{p_1^{r_1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{p_2^{r_2}} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}_{p_k^{r_k}}, \quad \text{and} \\ &amp;\mathbf{Z}_{q_1^{s_1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{q_2^{s_2}} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}_{q_l^{s_l}}, \end{align*} $$ and we don’t have to worry about \(G\). Now, we’ve seen before that if two groups are isomorphic, then the order of the elements in both groups must match up. We can’t use this fact to prove that two groups are isomorphic (though it can give us a clue). However, we can use it to show that groups are not isomorphic. So if they the orders don’t match up, then we can conclude that the given groups are not isomorphic. So the plan here is to count the orders of the elements in both of the products and if the numbers don’t match up, then these products are different. Though, we’re not going to use the order directly as the formula gets too complicated. We’ll use something slightly different, defined as follows Definition Define the subset \(G[m]: \{g \in G \ | \ g^m = e \} = \{g \in G \ | \ o(g) \ | \ m \text{ and } o(g) &lt; \infty \}\) Also define for finite groups Definition Define \(\alpha_m \rightarrow \mathbf{N}\) by \(\alpha_m(G) = |G[m]| \) Note that \(G[m]\) doesn’t need to be a subgroup but if \(G\) is abelian, then \(G[m] \leq G\). Example Suppose we have \(G = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,7\}\). Then, the orders of the elements are m 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 order 1 8 4 8 2 8 4 8 Let’s now compute the number of elements in each \(\alpha_m(G)\) m 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 16 \(\alpha_m(G)\) 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 8 1 1 8 Note that \(\alpha_3(G) = 1\) and that 3 and 8 are relatively prime. \(\alpha_6(G) = 2\) because only 0 and 4 have orders that divide 6. Three Properties of \(\alpha_m(G)\) We’ll prove three important properties about the function \(\alpha_m(G)\). Proposition 1 If \(G\) and \(H\) are finite groups and if \(G \cong H\), then \(\alpha_m(G) = \alpha_m(H)\) We say that \(\alpha_m\) is an isomorphism invariant of finite groups. Recall that \(\alpha_m\) is the number of elements that are the identity when raised to the power \(m\). So this says if \(G\) and \(H\) isomorphic, then they’ll have the same number of those elements. This makes sense since we know if they are isomorphic, then each group will have the same number of elements of each order. The orders must match. Proof Let \(\phi: G \rightarrow H\) be an isomorphism. We claim that \(\phi\) restricts to a bijection \(G[m] \rightarrow H[m]\). This would immediately apply that \(\alpha_m(G) = \alpha_m(H)\). \(\phi\) restricts to a function $$ \begin{align*} G[m] \rightarrow H[m] \\ g \rightarrow \phi(g) \end{align*} $$ We want to show that if \(g \in G[m]\), then \(\phi(g) \in H[m]\). Suppose that \(g^m = e\). Observe that $$ \begin{align*} \phi(g)^m &amp;= \phi(g^m) \quad \text{(because $\phi$ is a homomorphism)} \\ &amp;= \phi(e_g) \quad \text{(by the assumption)} \\ &amp;= e_H \end{align*} $$ Therefore, \(\phi(g) \in H[m]\). Now, since \(\phi\) is an isomorphism, then the inverse function \(\phi^{-1}: H \rightarrow G\) is also an isomorphism. We can use a similar argument to show that \(\phi^{-1}\) restricts to a function $$ \begin{align*} H[m] \rightarrow G[m] x \rightarrow \phi^{-1}(x) \end{align*} $$ Therefore, the restricted function \(G[m] \rightarrow H[m]\) is a bijection. \(\ \blacksquare\) Proposition 2 If \(G = G_1 \times G_2 \times ... \times G_k\) where \(G_i\) is a finite group, then $$ \begin{align*} \alpha_m(G) = \alpha_m(G_1) \cdot \alpha_m(G_2) \ \cdot \ ... \ \cdot \ \alpha_m(G_k) \end{align*} $$ Proof Since now we have a direct product, then $$ \begin{align*} G[m]: \{(g_1,g_2,...,g_k), g_i \in G_i \ | \ (g_1,g_2,...,g_k)^m = (e,e,...,e) \} \end{align*} $$ But we know that multiplication in a direct product is component wise so \((g_1,g_2,...,g_k)^m = (g_1^m,g_2^m,...,g_k^m)\). This implies that \(g_1 \in G_1[m]\) if \(g_1^m = e\) and so on for each component. Therefore, we can write \(G[m] = G_1[m] \times ... \times G_k[m]\). The size of this set is \(|G_1[m]| \times ... |G_k[m]|\) which is what we wanted to show. Proposition 3 If \(G = \mathbf{Z}_n\) (G is cyclic) where \(n \geq 1\), then $$ \begin{align*} \alpha_m(\mathbf{Z}_n) = d \quad \text{ where } d = gcd(m,n) \end{align*} $$ So when the group is cyclic, then the number of elements which become the identity when raised to the power \(m\) is exactly \(d\) where \(d\) is the gcd of \(m\) and \(n = |G|\). Proof Step (1): We will show that if \(G\) is a group (even if not cyclic) such that \(|G| = n\), then \(\alpha_m(G) = \alpha_d(G)\) where \(d = gcd(m,n)\). In fact, not only do \(G[m]\) and \(G[d]\) have the same size, we will show that they are exactly the same subset so \(G[m] = G[d]\). Recall that $$ \begin{align*} G[m]: \{g \in G \ | \ g^m = e \} \\ G[d]: \{g \in G \ | \ g^d = e \} \\ \end{align*} $$ \(G[d] \subseteq G[m]\): Since \(d = gcd(m,n)\), then \(d \ | \ m\) and \(m = ds\) for some \(s \in \mathbf{Z}\). Suppose that \(g^d = e\), then $$ \begin{align*} g^m = g^{ds} = (g^d)^s = e^s = e. \end{align*} $$ \(G[m] \subseteq G[d]\): We can also write \(d\) as \(d = sm + tn\) for some \(t, n \in \mathbf{Z}\). Since \(|G| = n\), then we know that \(g^n = e\) for any \(g \in G\) by the order theorem. So suppose that \(g^m = e\), then $$ \begin{align*} g^d = g^{sm + tn} = g^{sm} g^{tn} = (g^m)^s (g^n)^t = e. \end{align*} $$ So \(G[m] \subseteq G[d]\). Therefore, \(G[m] = G[d]\) and therefore \(\alpha_m(G) = \alpha_d(G)\). Step (2): We will show that if \(d \ | \ n\), then \(\alpha_d(\mathbf{Z}_n) = d\). We can calculate this. We know $$ \begin{align*} \mathbf{Z}_n = \{[1]_n, [2]_n,...,[n]_n\} \end{align*} $$ If \(1 \leq k \leq n\), then \(o([k]_n) = gcd(k,n)\). (we proved this before). We can use this to show that $$ \begin{align*} \mathbf{Z}_n[d] = \{[e]_n, [2w]_n,...,[de]_n\} \end{align*} $$ (Exercise). Combining Everything So now we have three propositions about \(\alpha_m[G]\) If \(G \cong H\), then \(\alpha_m(G) = \alpha_m(H)\) If \(G = G_1 \times G_2 \times ... \times G_k\) then \(\alpha_m(G) = \alpha_m(G_1) \cdot \alpha_m(G_2) \ \cdot \ ... \ \cdot \ \alpha_m(G_k)\) If \(p, q\) are primes where \(p \neq q\), then \(\alpha_{q^l}(\mathbf{Z}_{p^r}) = 1\) (Corollary from proposition 3 since the gcd will be 1). Furthermore, \(\alpha_{p^l}(\mathbf{Z}_{p^r}) = min(p^l, p^r)\). Note here that the gcd of \(p^l, p^r\) is exactly their minimum. We can see now how given a product of elementary divisors, we can compute \(\alpha_m\) on each factor using the propositions above. However, we’re not going to use exactly the function \(\alpha\). We will instead define the following $$ \begin{align*} \beta_{q^l} &amp;= \log_q \big\{ \frac{ \alpha_{q^l}(G)^2 }{ \alpha_{q^{l-1}}(G)\alpha_{q^{l+1}}(G) } \big\} \\ &amp;= 2\log_q \alpha_{q^l}(G) - \log_q \alpha_{q^{l-1}}(G) - \log_q \alpha_{q^{l+1}}(G) \end{align*} $$ So now we have the following facts based on the definition of \(\beta\) If \(G \cong H\), then \(\beta_{q^l}(G) = \beta_{q^l}(H)\). This is clear since \(\beta\)'s definition is based on \(\alpha\) If \(G = G_1 \times G_2 \times ... \times G_k\) then \(\beta_{q^l}(G) = \sum_{i=1}^k \beta_{q^l}(G_i)\) If \(p, q\) are primes where \(p \neq q\), then \(\alpha_{q^l}(\mathbf{Z}_{p^r}) = 0\). Furthermore, \(\alpha_{p^l}(\mathbf{Z}_{p^r}) = 1\) if \(l = r\) and it is 0 when \(l \neq r\). Example Suppose that \(G = \mathbf{Z}_{2^4} = \mathbf{Z}_{16}\). Then l 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 \(2^l\) 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 \(\alpha_{2^l}\) 1 2 4 8 16 16 16 16 16 \(\log_2 \alpha_{2^l}(G)\) 0 1 2 3 4 4 4 4 4 \(\beta_{2^l}(G)\) \ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 This here proves the uniqueness of elementary divisors. Why? if \(G\) is isomorphic to two products of elementary divisors.

\(\gamma\) will be a homomorphism from \(A\) to the group of automorphisms of \(N\). \(A\) contains two elements, \(A = \{e, j\}\). We will send each element to an automorphism from the set \(\text{Aut}(N) = \text{Aut}(\langle r \rangle)\). Specifically</p>

<h4><b>Construction of Semi-direct Products</b></h4>
<p>We haven’t said anything yet about how to actually construct \(G\) from the groups \(A\), \(N\) and \(\gamma\). The following will demonstrate this. (Important to note here that unlike the previous example, we don’t need \(A\) and \(N\) to be subgroups of \(G\). They are just groups!!!).
<br />
We will first demonstrate what happens when \(\gamma\) and \(\gamma_a\) are homomorphisms.
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Semi-direct Product Construction
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(A\) and \(N\) be groups and let
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\
	         a &amp;\rightarrow \gamma_a
	\end{align*}
	$$
be a homomorphism. Note here that not only \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism but also each \(\gamma_a\) is a homomorphism as well. Because of this we will get
<ol>
	<li>\(\gamma_a(n_1n_2) = \gamma_a(n_1) \cdot \gamma_a(n_2)\) for \(a \in A, n_1, n_2 \in N\).</li>
	<li>\(\gamma_{a_1a_2}(n) = \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n))\) for \(a_1, a_2 \in A, n \in N\).</li>
	<li>\(\gamma_{e} = id, \gamma_{a^{-1}} = (\gamma_a)^{-1}\).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
So now we will use these facts to state the semi-direct product definition.
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Semi-direct Product
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Use the construction above, we will get the group
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 G = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A
	\end{align*}
	$$
where the the product set is
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 G = N \times A = \{(n,a), n \in N, a \in A\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
The operation is
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(n_1, a_1) \cdot (n_2, a_2) = (n_1 \cdot \gamma_{a_1}(n_2), a_1a_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
where \(n_1, n_2 \in N\) and \(a_1, a_2 \in A\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Note also that \(N \cong N' \leq G\) so \(N\) is isomorphic to some subgroup of \(G\). \(A\) is also isomorphic to some subgroup to \(A' \leq G\). 
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br />
<br />
Also note that if this was a direct product, then the operation is \((n_1,a_1) \cdot (n_2,a_2) = (n_1n_2, a_1a_2)\) but here we have this application of \(\gamma_{a_1}\) on \(n_2\).
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We will show that \(G\) is a group by verifying the group properties.</p>
<ol>
    <!------------------------ASSOCIATIVITY--------------------------->
	<li>\(G\) is associative. The left hand side is
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	((n_1,a_1) \cdot (n_2,a_2)) \cdot (n_3,a_3) &amp;= (n_1 \gamma_{a_1}(n_2),a_1a_2) \cdot (n_3,a_3) \\
	                                            &amp;= (n_1 \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1a_2}(n_3),a_1a_2a_3).
													\end{align*}
	$$
</div>	
while the right hand side is
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(n_1,a_1) \cdot ((n_2,a_2) \cdot (n_3,a_3)) &amp;= (n_1,a_1) (n_1 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3),a_2a_3) \\
	                                            &amp;= (n_1, \gamma_{a_1}(n_2 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3)),  a_1a_2a_3).
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>	
	Recall the identities from the construction. Specifically, we saw that \(\gamma_a(n_1n_2) = \gamma_a(n_1) \cdot \gamma_a(n_2)\) and \(\gamma_{a_1a_2}(n) = \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n))\). Using this we see that term from the right hand side will equal to
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    \gamma_{a_1}(n_2 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3)) &amp;= \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n_3)) \\
		                                    &amp;= \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1a_2}(n_3)
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
which is the same as the term in the left hand side.
	</li>
    <!------------------------IDENTITIY--------------------------->
	<li>The identity element is \((e_N, e_A)\) (Exercise).</li>
    <!------------------------INVERSE--------------------------->
	<li>The inverse is \((n,a)^{-1} = (\gamma_{a^{-1}}(n^{-1}), a^{-1})\).</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<p>Let’s start with the trivial example. Let \(N\) and \(A\) be any groups. Define the trivial homomorphism as</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    \gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\
		                \gamma_{a} &amp;= id \quad \forall a \in A
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>This is a constant function that’s always a homomorphism no matter what the source and targets are. Basically send any element to the identity function. Then</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    N \rtimes_{\gamma} A = N \times A
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>To see this, apply the operation and you’ll see that \((a_1, a_2)(n_1, n_2) = (n_1 id(n_2), a_1a_2) = (n_1n_2, a_1a_2)\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<p>Let \(N = (\mathbf{Z}_n, +)\) where \(n \geq 3\) and let \(A = \mathbf{Z}_2 = \{[0]_2, [1]_2\}\). 
<br />
Define \(\gamma\) be</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_2 &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n)
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>We’ve seen before that \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n)\) is the modular units (mod n) group. How can we construct a homomorphism? We know that \(\mathbf{Z} = \{[0]_2, [1]_2\}\). We know we have to send \([0]_2\) to the identity element \([1]_n\). For \([1]_2\), we need to send it to an element of \(\Phi(n)\) of order 2. As an example, observe that \([-1]_n\) is of order 2 because \((-1)^2 = 1\). So</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_2 &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n) \\
		                 [0]_2  &amp;\rightarrow [1]_n \\
						 [1]_2	&amp;\rightarrow [-1]_n.
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>So we can now form a semi-direct product. Let \(G = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\). This is a group of order \(2n\). In fact, it’s isomorphic to the dihedral group \(D_n\). To see this, observe that we can replace \(N\) with \(N = \langle r \rangle\) and replace \(A\) with \(A = \langle j \rangle\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	N &amp;= \langle r \rangle, \ o(r) = n \\
	A &amp;= \langle j \rangle, \ o(j) = 2
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We can set \(\gamma\) like we did before. So</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\gamma: \langle j \rangle &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\langle r \rangle) \\
	\gamma_e &amp;\rightarrow id \\
	\gamma_j &amp;\rightarrow (r^k \rightarrow r^{-k}) \quad \text{(send $r^k$ to its inverse, similar to what we did to [1])}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Remark: If you have other elements of order 2 in \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n)\), then you can form “semi-dihedral groups”. For example, take \(N = \mathbf{Z}_8\), then Aut\((N) = \Phi(8) = \{1,3,5,7\}\). All the elements in this group is of order 2 except for 1. Therefore we can define</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    \gamma' : A=\langle j \rangle &amp;\rightarrow Aut(N) \cong \Phi(8) \\
		                           j   &amp;\rightarrow 3 \quad \text{ (instead of -1 like before)}
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>So now we’ll get a different semi-direct product. We’ll get \(G' = N \rtimes_{\gamma'} A\). \(|G'| = 16\). It is not isomorphic to \(D_8\). Also \(o(r) = 8\) and \(o(j) = 2\). But we have this new formula \(jr = r^3j\). (Instead of \(jr = jr^{-1})\). 
<br />

<h4><b>Recognition Theorem for Semi-direct Product</b></h4>
<p>So now we can state the Recognition Theorem but for Semi-direct Product.
<br /></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem (Recognition Theorem)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(A, N \leq G\) be two subgroups. If
<ol>
	<li>\(N\) is a normal subgroups of \(G\).</li>
	<li>\(A \cap N = \{e\}\)</li>
	<li>\(NA = G\)</li>
</ol>
Define \(\gamma\) as the homomorphism such that
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(G) \\
	 y_a(n) &amp;\rightarrow ana^{-1} \quad a \in A, a^{-1} \in N
	\end{align*}
	$$
Then, \(A \rtimes_{\gamma} N\) is isomorphic to \(G\). The isomorphism is given by
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		\gamma: A \rtimes_{\gamma} N &amp;\rightarrow G \\
		 (a,n) &amp;\rightarrow an
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
The idea of the proof is as follows. We are given that \(NA = G\). So we can write every element in \(G\) is a product of an element from \(N\) and an element from \(A\). Because we also have \(N \cap A = \{e\}\), then there is a unique way to write all of these products (proof?). So every \(g \in G\) can be written uniquely as a product \(g = na\) where \(n \in N\) and \(a \in A\). Now, take two different elements \(g_1 = n_1a_1\) and \(g_2 = n_2a_2\) where \(a_1,a_2 \in A\) and \(n_1n_2 \in N\). Multiply them</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		g_1g_2 &amp;= (n_1a_1)(n_2a_2)
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>But we also know that \(g_1g_2 \in G\) so it can also be written uniquely as a product \(g_1g_2 = na\) where \(n \in N\) and \(a \in A\). So we want to solve the equation \((n_1a_1)(n_2a_2) = na\) to get an expression that looks like \(na\). The trick is as follows</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		(n_1a_1)(n_2a_2) &amp;= n_1a_1n_2(a_1^{-1}a_1)a_2 \\
		                 &amp;= (n_1)(a_1n_2a_1^{-1})(a_1a_2)
		\end{align*}
		$$
	where
</div>
<p>\(n_1 \in N\), \(a_1n_2a_1^{-1} \in N\). \(a_1a_2 \in A\). So we can write \(n = n_1a_1n_2a_1^{-1}\) and \(a = a_1a_2\). But \(a_1n_2a_1^{-1}\) is just \(\gamma_{a_1}(n_2)\). This is exactly the product. we defined.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Infinite Dihedral Group</b></h4>
<p>So we’re to construct a group by a semi direct group. Set</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		N &amp;= \langle r \rangle \cong (\mathbf{Z}, +), \quad o(r)=\infty \\
		A &amp;= \langle j \rangle \cong (\mathbf{Z}_2, +), \quad o(j)=2
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>Define the homomorphism</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		\gamma: A \rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \cong \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}) = \{\pm 1\}, \quad o(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}) = 2)
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>There are two automorphisms of \(N\). The identity function. The other automorphism is the inverse function (\(inv(r^k) = r^{-k}\)). Intuitively, \(r\) has to go to another generator that can generate the group. So it can go to itself or its inverse. So now the infinite is defined to be the semi direct product of \(N\) and \(A\) so</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		D_{\infty} = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>Note here that \(N\) is a subgroup of \(D_{\infty}\). Send \(r^k \in N\) to</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		r^{k} \rightarrow (r^k, e)
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>And \(A\) is a subgroup of \(D_{\infty}\) so send \(j^l\) to</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		j^{l} \rightarrow (j^l, e)
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>In fact \(D_{\infty} = \langle r, j \rangle\) with \(o(r) = \infty\) and \(o(j) = 2\). Also see that \(jrj^{-1} = r^{-1} \leftrightarrow jr = r^{-1}j\)
<br />
<br />
Note here that this is NOT the same as the symmetries of the disk group. The symmetries of the disk is an uncountable group. Here we have integer powers of \(r\) while the symmetries of the disk can have any power, can rotate the disk by angle.

(Important to note here that unlike the previous example, we don’t need \(A\) and \(N\) to be subgroups of \(G\). They are just groups!!!). We will first demonstrate what happens when \(\gamma\) and \(\gamma_a\) are homomorphisms. Semi-direct Product Construction Let \(A\) and \(N\) be groups and let $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\ a &amp;\rightarrow \gamma_a \end{align*} $$ be a homomorphism. Note here that not only \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism but also each \(\gamma_a\) is a homomorphism as well. Because of this we will get \(\gamma_a(n_1n_2) = \gamma_a(n_1) \cdot \gamma_a(n_2)\) for \(a \in A, n_1, n_2 \in N\). \(\gamma_{a_1a_2}(n) = \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n))\) for \(a_1, a_2 \in A, n \in N\). \(\gamma_{e} = id, \gamma_{a^{-1}} = (\gamma_a)^{-1}\). So now we will use these facts to state the semi-direct product definition. Semi-direct Product Use the construction above, we will get the group $$ \begin{align*} G = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A \end{align*} $$ where the the product set is $$ \begin{align*} G = N \times A = \{(n,a), n \in N, a \in A\} \end{align*} $$ The operation is $$ \begin{align*} (n_1, a_1) \cdot (n_2, a_2) = (n_1 \cdot \gamma_{a_1}(n_2), a_1a_2) \end{align*} $$ where \(n_1, n_2 \in N\) and \(a_1, a_2 \in A\). Note also that \(N \cong N' \leq G\) so \(N\) is isomorphic to some subgroup of \(G\). \(A\) is also isomorphic to some subgroup to \(A' \leq G\). Also note that if this was a direct product, then the operation is \((n_1,a_1) \cdot (n_2,a_2) = (n_1n_2, a_1a_2)\) but here we have this application of \(\gamma_{a_1}\) on \(n_2\). Proof We will show that \(G\) is a group by verifying the group properties. \(G\) is associative. The left hand side is $$ \begin{align*} ((n_1,a_1) \cdot (n_2,a_2)) \cdot (n_3,a_3) &amp;= (n_1 \gamma_{a_1}(n_2),a_1a_2) \cdot (n_3,a_3) \\ &amp;= (n_1 \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1a_2}(n_3),a_1a_2a_3). \end{align*} $$ while the right hand side is $$ \begin{align*} (n_1,a_1) \cdot ((n_2,a_2) \cdot (n_3,a_3)) &amp;= (n_1,a_1) (n_1 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3),a_2a_3) \\ &amp;= (n_1, \gamma_{a_1}(n_2 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3)), a_1a_2a_3). \end{align*} $$ Recall the identities from the construction. Specifically, we saw that \(\gamma_a(n_1n_2) = \gamma_a(n_1) \cdot \gamma_a(n_2)\) and \(\gamma_{a_1a_2}(n) = \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n))\). Using this we see that term from the right hand side will equal to $$ \begin{align*} \gamma_{a_1}(n_2 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3)) &amp;= \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n_3)) \\ &amp;= \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1a_2}(n_3) \end{align*} $$ which is the same as the term in the left hand side. The identity element is \((e_N, e_A)\) (Exercise). The inverse is \((n,a)^{-1} = (\gamma_{a^{-1}}(n^{-1}), a^{-1})\). Example 1 Let’s start with the trivial example. Let \(N\) and \(A\) be any groups. Define the trivial homomorphism as $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\ \gamma_{a} &amp;= id \quad \forall a \in A \end{align*} $$ This is a constant function that’s always a homomorphism no matter what the source and targets are. Basically send any element to the identity function. Then $$ \begin{align*} N \rtimes_{\gamma} A = N \times A \end{align*} $$ To see this, apply the operation and you’ll see that \((a_1, a_2)(n_1, n_2) = (n_1 id(n_2), a_1a_2) = (n_1n_2, a_1a_2)\). Example 2 Let \(N = (\mathbf{Z}_n, +)\) where \(n \geq 3\) and let \(A = \mathbf{Z}_2 = \{[0]_2, [1]_2\}\). Define \(\gamma\) be $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_2 &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n) \end{align*} $$ We’ve seen before that \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n)\) is the modular units (mod n) group. How can we construct a homomorphism? We know that \(\mathbf{Z} = \{[0]_2, [1]_2\}\). We know we have to send \([0]_2\) to the identity element \([1]_n\). For \([1]_2\), we need to send it to an element of \(\Phi(n)\) of order 2. As an example, observe that \([-1]_n\) is of order 2 because \((-1)^2 = 1\). So $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_2 &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n) \\ [0]_2 &amp;\rightarrow [1]_n \\ [1]_2 &amp;\rightarrow [-1]_n. \end{align*} $$ So we can now form a semi-direct product. Let \(G = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\). This is a group of order \(2n\). In fact, it’s isomorphic to the dihedral group \(D_n\). To see this, observe that we can replace \(N\) with \(N = \langle r \rangle\) and replace \(A\) with \(A = \langle j \rangle\). $$ \begin{align*} N &amp;= \langle r \rangle, \ o(r) = n \\ A &amp;= \langle j \rangle, \ o(j) = 2 \end{align*} $$ We can set \(\gamma\) like we did before. So $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: \langle j \rangle &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\langle r \rangle) \\ \gamma_e &amp;\rightarrow id \\ \gamma_j &amp;\rightarrow (r^k \rightarrow r^{-k}) \quad \text{(send $r^k$ to its inverse, similar to what we did to [1])} \end{align*} $$ Remark: If you have other elements of order 2 in \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n)\), then you can form “semi-dihedral groups”. For example, take \(N = \mathbf{Z}_8\), then Aut\((N) = \Phi(8) = \{1,3,5,7\}\). All the elements in this group is of order 2 except for 1. Therefore we can define $$ \begin{align*} \gamma' : A=\langle j \rangle &amp;\rightarrow Aut(N) \cong \Phi(8) \\ j &amp;\rightarrow 3 \quad \text{ (instead of -1 like before)} \end{align*} $$ So now we’ll get a different semi-direct product. We’ll get \(G' = N \rtimes_{\gamma'} A\). \(|G'| = 16\). It is not isomorphic to \(D_8\). Also \(o(r) = 8\) and \(o(j) = 2\). But we have this new formula \(jr = r^3j\). (Instead of \(jr = jr^{-1})\). Recognition Theorem for Semi-direct Product So now we can state the Recognition Theorem but for Semi-direct Product. Theorem (Recognition Theorem) Let \(G\) be a group and let \(A, N \leq G\) be two subgroups. If \(N\) is a normal subgroups of \(G\). \(A \cap N = \{e\}\) \(NA = G\) Define \(\gamma\) as the homomorphism such that $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(G) \\ y_a(n) &amp;\rightarrow ana^{-1} \quad a \in A, a^{-1} \in N \end{align*} $$ Then, \(A \rtimes_{\gamma} N\) is isomorphic to \(G\). The isomorphism is given by $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: A \rtimes_{\gamma} N &amp;\rightarrow G \\ (a,n) &amp;\rightarrow an \end{align*} $$ Proof The idea of the proof is as follows. We are given that \(NA = G\). So we can write every element in \(G\) is a product of an element from \(N\) and an element from \(A\). Because we also have \(N \cap A = \{e\}\), then there is a unique way to write all of these products (proof?). So every \(g \in G\) can be written uniquely as a product \(g = na\) where \(n \in N\) and \(a \in A\). Now, take two different elements \(g_1 = n_1a_1\) and \(g_2 = n_2a_2\) where \(a_1,a_2 \in A\) and \(n_1n_2 \in N\). Multiply them $$ \begin{align*} g_1g_2 &amp;= (n_1a_1)(n_2a_2) \end{align*} $$ But we also know that \(g_1g_2 \in G\) so it can also be written uniquely as a product \(g_1g_2 = na\) where \(n \in N\) and \(a \in A\). So we want to solve the equation \((n_1a_1)(n_2a_2) = na\) to get an expression that looks like \(na\). The trick is as follows $$ \begin{align*} (n_1a_1)(n_2a_2) &amp;= n_1a_1n_2(a_1^{-1}a_1)a_2 \\ &amp;= (n_1)(a_1n_2a_1^{-1})(a_1a_2) \end{align*} $$ where \(n_1 \in N\), \(a_1n_2a_1^{-1} \in N\). \(a_1a_2 \in A\). So we can write \(n = n_1a_1n_2a_1^{-1}\) and \(a = a_1a_2\). But \(a_1n_2a_1^{-1}\) is just \(\gamma_{a_1}(n_2)\). This is exactly the product. we defined. Infinite Dihedral Group So we’re to construct a group by a semi direct group. Set $$ \begin{align*} N &amp;= \langle r \rangle \cong (\mathbf{Z}, +), \quad o(r)=\infty \\ A &amp;= \langle j \rangle \cong (\mathbf{Z}_2, +), \quad o(j)=2 \end{align*} $$ Define the homomorphism $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: A \rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \cong \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}) = \{\pm 1\}, \quad o(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}) = 2) \end{align*} $$ There are two automorphisms of \(N\). The identity function. The other automorphism is the inverse function (\(inv(r^k) = r^{-k}\)). Intuitively, \(r\) has to go to another generator that can generate the group. So it can go to itself or its inverse. So now the infinite is defined to be the semi direct product of \(N\) and \(A\) so $$ \begin{align*} D_{\infty} = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A \end{align*} $$ Note here that \(N\) is a subgroup of \(D_{\infty}\). Send \(r^k \in N\) to $$ \begin{align*} r^{k} \rightarrow (r^k, e) \end{align*} $$ And \(A\) is a subgroup of \(D_{\infty}\) so send \(j^l\) to $$ \begin{align*} j^{l} \rightarrow (j^l, e) \end{align*} $$ In fact \(D_{\infty} = \langle r, j \rangle\) with \(o(r) = \infty\) and \(o(j) = 2\). Also see that \(jrj^{-1} = r^{-1} \leftrightarrow jr = r^{-1}j\) Note here that this is NOT the same as the symmetries of the disk group. The symmetries of the disk is an uncountable group. Here we have integer powers of \(r\) while the symmetries of the disk can have any power, can rotate the disk by angle.

Restating this
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition: Direct Products
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Suppose \(A\) and \(B\) are groups. Then the Direct Product:
$$
\begin{align*}
G = A \times B = \{(a,b) \ | \ a \in A, b \in B\}
\end{align*}
$$
With Operation:
$$
\begin{align*}
(a_1, b_1) \cdot (a_2, b_2) = (a_1a_2, b_1b_2)
\end{align*}
$$
is a group. The identity element \(e_{A \times B} = (a_G, b_H)\) and the inverse of \((a,b)\) is \((a^{-1},b^{-1})\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Observation: \(A' = \{(a,e_{b}) \ | \ a \in A \}\) and \(B' = \{(e_a,b) \ | \ b \in B \}\) are subgroups of \(G\). Moreover, \(A'\) is isomorphic to \(A\) and \(B'\) is isomorphic to \(B\). We also note that</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(A'\) and \(B'\) are normal subgroups of \(G\). To see this, observe that for \((a, e) \in A'\) and \((x, y) \in G\)</li>
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		(x, y)(a, e)(x, y)^{-1} =  (xax^{-1}, yey^{-1}) = (xax^{-1}, e) \in A'
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
	<li>\(A' \cap B' = \{e_A, e_B\}\)</li>
	<li>\(A'B' = \{xy \ | \ x \in A', y \in B'\} = G\)</li>
</ul>
<p>From this, we have the following proposition
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem (Recognition Theorem)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and \(A, B \leq G\). If
<ol>
	<li>\(A\) and \(B\) are normal subgroups of \(G\).</li>
	<li>\(A \cap B = \{e\}\)</li>
	<li>\(AB = G\)</li>
</ol>
Then, \(A \times B\) is isomorphic to \(G\). The isomorphism is given by
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: A \times B &amp;\rightarrow G \\
	 (a,b) &amp;\rightarrow ab
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We need to show that \(\phi\) is a homomorphism and that it is surjective and injective. 
<br />
<br />
Claim: If \(a \in A, b \in B\), then \(ab = ba\). Note that this doesn’t say anything about whether \(G\), \(A\) or \(B\) are abelian. 
<br />
Proof: To see this, observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e \implies ab = ba
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is because we can just multiply by each element’s inverse on both sides. Now observe that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = (aba^{-1})b^{-1}\). We know that \(B\) is normal so \(aba^{-1} \in B\). \(b^{-1}\) is also in \(B\) since \(B\) is a subgroup. Therefore, \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in B\). Similarly, observe that that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = a(ba^{-1}b^{-1})\). \(A\) is normal so \(ba^{-1}b^{-1}\) is in \(A\). So \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A\). So now we have \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A\) and \(aba^{-1}b^{-1}\). This means that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A \cap B\). But \(A \cap B = \{e\}\) so \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e\) and therefore \(ab = ba\).
<br />
<br />
Now, to show that \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism, we want to show that \(\varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot (a_2,b_2)) = \varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot \varphi(a_2,b_2)\). The left hand side is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot (a_2,b_2)) = \varphi((a_1a_2, b_1b_2)) = a_1a_2b_1b_2.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>while the right hand side is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot \varphi(a_2,b_2) &amp;= a_1b_1 \cdot a_2b_2 \\
	                                        &amp;= a_1(b_1a_2)b_2 \\
											&amp;= a_1(a_2b_1)b_2 \quad \text{(by the claim we proved)} \\
											&amp;= a_1a_2b_1b_2.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. Next, we show that \(\varphi\) is surjective. But this is true by property (3) since \(AB = G\). Finally, we want to show that \(\varphi\) is injective. This is equivalent to showing that \(\ker(\varphi) = \{e\}\). By definition,</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(\varphi) = \{ (a,b) \in G \ | \ \varphi((a,b)) = ab = e \}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So we need all the products such that \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\) where \((a,b)=(e,e)\). So suppose \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\) and \(ab = e\). The trick here is to move everything to the other side so that \(a = b^{-1}\). Here, \(a \in A\) and \(b^{-1} \in B\). But \(A \cap B = \{e\}\). So \(a = b = e\). So \(\ker(\varphi) = \{(e,e)\}\). From this we see that it is an isomorphism as we wanted to show.
<br />

<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_{12}\). Let \(A = \langle [3] \rangle = \{[0],[3],[6],[9]\}\). Let \(B = \langle [3] \rangle = \{[0],[4],[8]\}\) Both \(A\) and \(B\) are subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}_{12}\). Check all three properties</p>
<ul>
	<li>Are they normal? Yes because \(A\) and \(B\) are abelian since \(\mathbf{Z}_{12}\) is abelian.</li>
	<li>\(A \cap B = \{[0]\}\) since we listed the elements above.</li>
	<li>The product subset is \(A+B = \{x+y \in A, y \in B\} = G\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note here that we already know that \(\mathbf{Z}_3 \times \mathbf{Z}_4 \cong \mathbf{Z}_{12}\) by the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Automorphism of a group \(G\)</b></h4>
<p>An Automorphism of a group \(G\) is just an isomorphism from the group to itself. The identity map is the easiest example of an automorphism but there can be others.
<br />
<br />
Example: Let \(V = \{e, a, b, c\}\) (The Klien 4-group)(\(\cong \mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_2)\). We know that \(a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e\). The products are</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	ab &amp;= ba = c \\
	ac &amp;= ca = b \\
	bc &amp;= cb = a
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Now define \(\varphi: V \rightarrow V\) such that \(\varphi(e) = e\), \(\varphi(a) = b\), \(\varphi(b) = b\), \(\varphi(c)=a\). \(\varphi\) is an automorphism. This is because</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(\varphi\) is both injective and surjective so it is a bijection.</li>
	<li>\(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. We can check that \(\varphi(xy) = \varphi(x)\varphi(y)\)</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, there are six automorphisms of \(V\). Note here that the six automorphisms are basically permutations on the set of elements. There are exactly 24 permutations on a set of 4 elements. But we also need to satisfy the homomorphism condition. This means that for example, it will need to send the identity element to the identity element. So now how many permutations are available if the identity element is fixed? There are 6 permutations. In this example, this is also the answer to the number of automorphisms. 
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
The collection of automorphisms is called \(\text{Aut}(G) = \{\varphi: G \rightarrow G \ | \ \varphi \text{ is an  automorphism}\}\). This is a subgroup of the permutation group \(Sym(G)\) as we saw. Also note here that since Aut\((G)\) is a subgroup, then \(|\text{Aut}(G)|\) must divide \(G\) if \(G\) is finite. 
<br />
<br />
For example, we can see using the example above that Aut\((V)\) is isomorphic to \(S_3\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_n\) where \(n \geq 1\). Does this group have automorphisms other than the identity? <br />
For example, let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_{15}\). Define the following function</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi: \mathbf{Z}_{15} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_{15} \\
	            \varphi([x]) &amp;= [2x] = [2][x].
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The claim is that \(\varphi\) is an automorphism. It is a homomorphism because</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi([x]+[y]) &amp;= \varphi([2]([x]+[y])) \\
	                 &amp;= \varphi([2][x]+[2][y]) \\
	                 &amp;= \varphi([x]) + \varphi([y]).
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>It is also a bijection. Note that we’re multiplying by \([2]\). In \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\) (mod 15), \([2]\) has a multiplicate inverse since 2 and 15 are relatively prime. In fact, its multiplicative inverse is \([8]\) because \([2][8] = [16\%15] = [1]\). Therefore, to get the inverse, we just need to multiply by \([8]\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi^{-1}([y]) = [8][y].
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Therefore, \(\varphi\) is a bijection. Thus, it is an automorphism. In fact, this generalizes to \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). Every modular unit mod n gives us an automorphism for \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). This is captured in the following proposition
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
\(\text{Aut}(G) \cong \Phi(n)\). The automorphism is given by
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	[a] &amp;\rightarrow \gamma(a) \\
	\gamma_{[a]}([x]) &amp;= [ax]
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p><br />
Note here that \(\gamma(a)\) is a function. The isomorphism is between a group of functions and the modular unit \(a\). 
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Suppose \(\varphi \in \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n)\). Let \([a] = \varphi([1])\). Then we can show that \(\varphi([x]) = [ax]\). 
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Example: What about \(\mathbf{Z}\)? What are the automorphism? Aut\((\mathbf{Z}) = \{\pm 1\}\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>More Automorphisms</b></h4>
<p>Some more definitions:
<br /></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition (The "conjugation by \(g\)" function)
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Given \(g \in G\), define \(c_g: G \rightarrow G\) by \(c_g(x) = gxg^{-1}\)
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Some facts about this function:</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(c_g \in \text{Aut}(G)\). So \(c_g\) is an automorphism and it has an inverse \(c^{-1}_g\). Furthermore, if \(G\) is abelian, then \(c_g = id\) because \(gxg^{-1}\) will reduce to just \(x\) when \(G\) is abelian</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also define the function</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	c: G &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(G) \\
	g &amp;\rightarrow c_g
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This function is a homomorphism. What does this mean? It means that conjugating by a product \(ab\) is the same as conjugating by \(a\) and then by \(b\). \(c_{ab} = c_a \circ c_b\).
<br />
<br />
Since it’s a homomorphism, we can check its kernel. It’s kernel is as follows</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(c) = \mathbf{Z}(G)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Which is called the center of “G”.
<br />
<br />
Additionally, we have the subgroup \(c(G)\) which is the image of \(G\) under \(c\). \(c(G)\) is a subgroup of Aut\((G)\). This subgroup is usually called \(Inn(G)\) (subgroup of inner automorphism). Fact: Inn\((G)\) is a normal subgroup of Aut\((G)\).
<br />
<br />
Since Inn\((G)\) is normal, we can then form the quotient group Out\((G) = \text{Aut}/\text{Inn}(G)\). This group is called the outer automorphism.

Similarly, observe that that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = a(ba^{-1}b^{-1})\). \(A\) is normal so \(ba^{-1}b^{-1}\) is in \(A\). So \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A\). So now we have \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A\) and \(aba^{-1}b^{-1}\). This means that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A \cap B\). But \(A \cap B = \{e\}\) so \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e\) and therefore \(ab = ba\). Now, to show that \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism, we want to show that \(\varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot (a_2,b_2)) = \varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot \varphi(a_2,b_2)\). The left hand side is $$ \begin{align*} \varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot (a_2,b_2)) = \varphi((a_1a_2, b_1b_2)) = a_1a_2b_1b_2. \end{align*} $$ while the right hand side is $$ \begin{align*} \varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot \varphi(a_2,b_2) &amp;= a_1b_1 \cdot a_2b_2 \\ &amp;= a_1(b_1a_2)b_2 \\ &amp;= a_1(a_2b_1)b_2 \quad \text{(by the claim we proved)} \\ &amp;= a_1a_2b_1b_2. \end{align*} $$ So \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. Next, we show that \(\varphi\) is surjective. But this is true by property (3) since \(AB = G\). Finally, we want to show that \(\varphi\) is injective. This is equivalent to showing that \(\ker(\varphi) = \{e\}\). By definition, $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\varphi) = \{ (a,b) \in G \ | \ \varphi((a,b)) = ab = e \} \end{align*} $$ So we need all the products such that \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\) where \((a,b)=(e,e)\). So suppose \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\) and \(ab = e\). The trick here is to move everything to the other side so that \(a = b^{-1}\). Here, \(a \in A\) and \(b^{-1} \in B\). But \(A \cap B = \{e\}\). So \(a = b = e\). So \(\ker(\varphi) = \{(e,e)\}\). From this we see that it is an isomorphism as we wanted to show. Example Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_{12}\). Let \(A = \langle [3] \rangle = \{[0],[3],[6],[9]\}\). Let \(B = \langle [3] \rangle = \{[0],[4],[8]\}\) Both \(A\) and \(B\) are subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}_{12}\). Check all three properties Are they normal? Yes because \(A\) and \(B\) are abelian since \(\mathbf{Z}_{12}\) is abelian. \(A \cap B = \{[0]\}\) since we listed the elements above. The product subset is \(A+B = \{x+y \in A, y \in B\} = G\) Note here that we already know that \(\mathbf{Z}_3 \times \mathbf{Z}_4 \cong \mathbf{Z}_{12}\) by the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Automorphism of a group \(G\) An Automorphism of a group \(G\) is just an isomorphism from the group to itself. The identity map is the easiest example of an automorphism but there can be others. Example: Let \(V = \{e, a, b, c\}\) (The Klien 4-group)(\(\cong \mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_2)\). We know that \(a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e\). The products are $$ \begin{align*} ab &amp;= ba = c \\ ac &amp;= ca = b \\ bc &amp;= cb = a \end{align*} $$ Now define \(\varphi: V \rightarrow V\) such that \(\varphi(e) = e\), \(\varphi(a) = b\), \(\varphi(b) = b\), \(\varphi(c)=a\). \(\varphi\) is an automorphism. This is because \(\varphi\) is both injective and surjective so it is a bijection. \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. We can check that \(\varphi(xy) = \varphi(x)\varphi(y)\) In fact, there are six automorphisms of \(V\). Note here that the six automorphisms are basically permutations on the set of elements. There are exactly 24 permutations on a set of 4 elements. But we also need to satisfy the homomorphism condition. This means that for example, it will need to send the identity element to the identity element. So now how many permutations are available if the identity element is fixed? There are 6 permutations. In this example, this is also the answer to the number of automorphisms. The collection of automorphisms is called \(\text{Aut}(G) = \{\varphi: G \rightarrow G \ | \ \varphi \text{ is an automorphism}\}\). This is a subgroup of the permutation group \(Sym(G)\) as we saw. Also note here that since Aut\((G)\) is a subgroup, then \(|\text{Aut}(G)|\) must divide \(G\) if \(G\) is finite. For example, we can see using the example above that Aut\((V)\) is isomorphic to \(S_3\). Example Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_n\) where \(n \geq 1\). Does this group have automorphisms other than the identity? For example, let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_{15}\). Define the following function $$ \begin{align*} \varphi: \mathbf{Z}_{15} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_{15} \\ \varphi([x]) &amp;= [2x] = [2][x]. \end{align*} $$ The claim is that \(\varphi\) is an automorphism. It is a homomorphism because $$ \begin{align*} \varphi([x]+[y]) &amp;= \varphi([2]([x]+[y])) \\ &amp;= \varphi([2][x]+[2][y]) \\ &amp;= \varphi([x]) + \varphi([y]). \end{align*} $$ It is also a bijection. Note that we’re multiplying by \([2]\). In \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\) (mod 15), \([2]\) has a multiplicate inverse since 2 and 15 are relatively prime. In fact, its multiplicative inverse is \([8]\) because \([2][8] = [16\%15] = [1]\). Therefore, to get the inverse, we just need to multiply by \([8]\). $$ \begin{align*} \varphi^{-1}([y]) = [8][y]. \end{align*} $$ Therefore, \(\varphi\) is a bijection. Thus, it is an automorphism. In fact, this generalizes to \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). Every modular unit mod n gives us an automorphism for \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). This is captured in the following proposition Proposition \(\text{Aut}(G) \cong \Phi(n)\). The automorphism is given by $$ \begin{align*} [a] &amp;\rightarrow \gamma(a) \\ \gamma_{[a]}([x]) &amp;= [ax] \end{align*} $$ Note here that \(\gamma(a)\) is a function. The isomorphism is between a group of functions and the modular unit \(a\). Proof Suppose \(\varphi \in \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n)\). Let \([a] = \varphi([1])\). Then we can show that \(\varphi([x]) = [ax]\). Example: What about \(\mathbf{Z}\)? What are the automorphism? Aut\((\mathbf{Z}) = \{\pm 1\}\) More Automorphisms Some more definitions: Definition (The "conjugation by \(g\)" function) Given \(g \in G\), define \(c_g: G \rightarrow G\) by \(c_g(x) = gxg^{-1}\) Some facts about this function: \(c_g \in \text{Aut}(G)\). So \(c_g\) is an automorphism and it has an inverse \(c^{-1}_g\). Furthermore, if \(G\) is abelian, then \(c_g = id\) because \(gxg^{-1}\) will reduce to just \(x\) when \(G\) is abelian We can also define the function $$ \begin{align*} c: G &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(G) \\ g &amp;\rightarrow c_g \end{align*} $$ This function is a homomorphism. What does this mean? It means that conjugating by a product \(ab\) is the same as conjugating by \(a\) and then by \(b\). \(c_{ab} = c_a \circ c_b\). Since it’s a homomorphism, we can check its kernel. It’s kernel is as follows $$ \begin{align*} \ker(c) = \mathbf{Z}(G) \end{align*} $$ Which is called the center of “G”. Additionally, we have the subgroup \(c(G)\) which is the image of \(G\) under \(c\). \(c(G)\) is a subgroup of Aut\((G)\). This subgroup is usually called \(Inn(G)\) (subgroup of inner automorphism). Fact: Inn\((G)\) is a normal subgroup of Aut\((G)\). Since Inn\((G)\) is normal, we can then form the quotient group Out\((G) = \text{Aut}/\text{Inn}(G)\). This group is called the outer automorphism. References MATH417 by Charles Rezk Algebra: Abstract and Concrete by Frederick M.

<h4><b>Generalizing Direct Products</b></h4>

Definition: Generalized Direct Products

<div class="mintbodydiv">
Suppose \(G_1, G_2,...,G_r\) are groups. Then

$$
is a group.
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let’s take the previous example but slightly modify it so that \(G = \langle a \rangle\) where \(o(a) = 2\) and \(H = \langle b \rangle\) with \(o(b) = 3\). So now we’re get 6 elements instead in the group</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
G \times H = \{ (e,e), (a,e), (e,b), (a,b), (e,b^2), (a, b^2)\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This group is cyclic. It must contain an element of order 5 that generates the group. If we let \((a, b) = x\), then we’ll see that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
(a,b) \cdot (a,b) &amp;= (e, b^2) = x^2 \\
(e, b^2) \cdot (a,b)  &amp;= (a, e) = x^3 \\
(a, e) \cdot (a,b)  &amp;= (e, b) = x^4 \\
(e, b) \cdot (a,b)  &amp;= (a, b^2) = x^5.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>At some point when we get to \(x^4\), we know by Lagrange, that the order of the element will be 6. This group is in fact isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_3 \cong \mathbf{Z}_6\).
<br />
<br />
Why was this example different? why was this one cyclic. Because 2 and 3 are prime numbers. \(a\) has order \(2\) and \(b\) is of order \(3\). To get to the identity element, we will need a power that is the least common multiple which is 6.
<br />
<br />
We can formalize this idea in the next proposition
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(a, b \geq 1\). The formula 
$$
\begin{align*}
\gamma(x) = ([x]_a, [x]_b)
\end{align*}
$$
defines a homomorphism \(\gamma: \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) such that
$$
\begin{align*}
\ker(\gamma) = \mathbf{Z}m \ \text{ (multiples of $m$ where } m=lcm(a,b)).
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
First note that \(\gamma\) is well defined. Next, we want to show that \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism. Since we’re working on \(\mathbf{Z}_a\) and \(\mathbf{Z}_b\), then we want to show that \(\gamma(x+y) = \gamma(x) + \gamma(y)\). Observe that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\gamma(x+y) &amp;= ([x+y]_a, [x+y]_b) \\
            &amp;= ([x]_a + [y]_a, [x]_b, [y]_b) \\
			&amp;= ([x]_a, [x]_b) + ([y]_a, [y]_b) \\
			&amp;= \gamma(x) + \gamma(y) \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Next, we want to show that the kernel is the set of multiples of \(m\) so \(\ker(\gamma) = \mathbf{Z}m\) where \(m = lcm(a,b)\). By definition,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\ker(\gamma) &amp;= \{x \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \gamma(x) = ([x]_a, [x]_b) = ([0]_a, [0]_b)\}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>In other words, we want \(x\) such that \(x \equiv 0 (\bmod a)\) and \(x \equiv 0 (\bmod b)\) divides \(x\). That is \(a\) divides \(x\) and \(b\) divides \(x\). This is the set of multiples of \(m\). Therefore</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\ker(\gamma) &amp;= \mathbf{Z}a \cap \mathbf{Z}b = \mathbf{Z}m.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>where \(m = lcm(a,b) = \frac{ab}{gcd(a,b)}\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>A New Homomorphism</b></h4>
<p>As a consequence of this, we will get an injective homomorphism from the quotient group \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}m\) which is \(\mathbf{Z}_m\) to \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) as follows</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{Z}_m &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b  \\
                        [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_a, [x]_b)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Why? Recall that we defined a homomorphism \(\gamma\) from \(\mathbf{Z}\) to \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\). Its kernel \(K = \mathbf{Z}m\). By the Homomorphism Theorem, we get another homomorphism from the quotient group \(\mathbf{Z}/K\) to the same target group \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\). Also recall that since \(\ker(\gamma) = K = \mathbf{Z}m\), then the new homomorphism is also injective.
<br />
<br />
When will the homomorphism be surjective? Since it’s injective, then it suffices that to show that \(|\mathbf{Z}_m| = |\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b|\). So when will they have the same size?

If \(a, b \geq 1\) and \(gcd(a,b) = 1\). Then we have an isomorphism

<h4><b>The Multiplicative Group</b></h4>
<p>Recall \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) is not just a group but a ring with two operations addition and multiplication. Inside this ring, we can focus on the elements that have a multiplicative inverse and form \(\Phi(n) = \{u \in \mathbf{Z}_n \ |\) u has a multiplicative inverse \(\} \subseteq \mathbf{Z}_n\). \((\Phi(n),\cdot)\) is a group with the multiplication operation. This group is also abelian and is called “modular units”. It is not a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}_n\).
<br />
<br />
It turns out that we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to decompose \(\Phi(n)\), the modular units group. Before listing the theorem recall that if \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\). Then \([x]_n \in \Phi(n)\) if and only if \(gcd(x,n)=1\). 
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
If \(a, b \geq 1\), \(gcd(a, b) = 1\) and \(m = ab\). Then there is an isomorphism

\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>where \(u_1, u_2 \in \mathbf{Z}_a\) and \(v_1,v_2 \in \mathbf{Z}_b\). The two operations (addition and multiplication) make \(R = \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) a ring. We have two claims:
<br />
<br />
Claim 1: \(\gamma(xy) = ([xy]_a, [xy]_b)\)
<br />
This is true because we know \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism. So</p>

\gamma(xy)=\gamma(x)\gamma(y) &amp;= ([x]_a, [x]_b)\cdot ([y]_a, [y]_b) \\

</div>
<p>which is a bijection. why?</p>
<ul>
<li>if \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\) such that \([x]_m \in \Phi(m)\), then we know that \(gcd(x,m) = 1\). We defined \(m = ab\). So if \(x\) is relatively prime to \(m\), then it must be relatively prime to the factors of \(m\), so \(gcd(x,b) = 1\). This means that \([x]_a \in \Phi(a)\) and \([x]_b \in \Phi(b)\). </li>
<li>\(\gamma'\) is injective because \(\gamma\) is an injective function.</li>
<li>\(\gamma'\) is surjective. \(\gamma\) is a bijection so every element of \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) has the form \([x]_a, [x]_b\) for some \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\). This means that \(gcd(x,a) = 1 = gcd(x, b)\). So \(gcd(x,ab) = 1\).</li>
</ul>

There are other ways to construct groups like the following Definition: Direct Products Suppose \(G\) and \(H\) are groups. Then the Direct Product: $$ \begin{align*} G \times H = \{(g,h) \ | \ g \in G, h \in H\} \end{align*} $$ With Operation: $$ \begin{align*} (g_1, h_1) \cdot (g_2, h_2) = (g_1g_2, h_1h_2) \end{align*} $$ is a group. The identity element \(e_{G \times H} = (e_G, e_H)\) and the inverse of \((g,h)\) is \((g^{-1},h^{-1})\). You can verify that this is indeed a group (Exercise). Example Let \(G = \langle a \rangle\) where \(o(a) = 2\) and \(H = \langle b \rangle\) with \(o(b) = 2\). Then $$ \begin{align*} G \times H = \{ (e,e), (a,e), (e,b), (a,b)\} \end{align*} $$ Note that this is a group. Since it has four elements then it must be isomorphic to either \(V\) ( symmetries of the rectangle) or the cyclic one (so we need an element of order 4). To classify this group, we need to find the order of each element. $$ \begin{align*} (a,b)^2 &amp;= (a,b) \cdot (a,b) = (aa, bb) = (e, e) \quad \text{(because the order of a and b is 2)} \\ (a,e)^2 &amp;= (e,e) = (e,b)^2. \end{align*} $$ From this we see that each element is of order 2 since \(G \times H\) is isomorphic to \(V\) (The Klien 4-group which is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_2\)). Properties of Direct Product Groups These are some facts about direct product groups Proposition Let \(G\) and \(H\) be groups. Then the size of \(G \times H\) is \(|G \times H| = |G||H|\). Proposition Let \(G_1 \cong G_2\) and \(H_1 \cong H_2\) be groups. Then \(G_1 \times H_1 \cong G_2 \times H_2\). Proof To show that two groups are isomorphic, we need to provide an isomorphism between the two groups. Since we know that \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) are isomorphic, then let \(\alpha : G_1 \rightarrow G_2\) be an isomorphism. Similarly, since \(H_1\) and \(H_2\) are isomorphic, then let \(\beta : H_1 \rightarrow H_2\) be an isomorphism. Then we claim that $$ \begin{align*} \gamma : G_1 \times H_1 &amp;\rightarrow H_2 \times G_2 \\ \gamma(g, h) &amp;= (\alpha(g), \beta(h)). \end{align*} $$ is an isomorphism. [TODO … verify] Generalizing Direct Products We can generalize the definition of direct products to say Definition: Generalized Direct Products Suppose \(G_1, G_2,...,G_r\) are groups. Then $$ \begin{align*} \bar{G} &amp;= G_1 \times G_2 \times .... \times G_r \\ &amp;= \{(g_1, g_2,...,g_r) \ | \ g_i \in G_i\} \end{align*} $$ With Operation: $$ \begin{align*} (g_1, g_2, ..., g_r) \cdot (g'_1,g'_2, ..., g'_r) = (g_1g'_1, g_2g'_2, ..., g_rg'_r) \end{align*} $$ is a group. Example Let’s take the previous example but slightly modify it so that \(G = \langle a \rangle\) where \(o(a) = 2\) and \(H = \langle b \rangle\) with \(o(b) = 3\). So now we’re get 6 elements instead in the group $$ \begin{align*} G \times H = \{ (e,e), (a,e), (e,b), (a,b), (e,b^2), (a, b^2)\} \end{align*} $$ This group is cyclic. It must contain an element of order 5 that generates the group. If we let \((a, b) = x\), then we’ll see that $$ \begin{align*} (a,b) \cdot (a,b) &amp;= (e, b^2) = x^2 \\ (e, b^2) \cdot (a,b) &amp;= (a, e) = x^3 \\ (a, e) \cdot (a,b) &amp;= (e, b) = x^4 \\ (e, b) \cdot (a,b) &amp;= (a, b^2) = x^5. \end{align*} $$ At some point when we get to \(x^4\), we know by Lagrange, that the order of the element will be 6. This group is in fact isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_3 \cong \mathbf{Z}_6\). Why was this example different? why was this one cyclic. Because 2 and 3 are prime numbers. \(a\) has order \(2\) and \(b\) is of order \(3\). To get to the identity element, we will need a power that is the least common multiple which is 6. We can formalize this idea in the next proposition Proposition Let \(a, b \geq 1\). The formula $$ \begin{align*} \gamma(x) = ([x]_a, [x]_b) \end{align*} $$ defines a homomorphism \(\gamma: \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) such that $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\gamma) = \mathbf{Z}m \ \text{ (multiples of $m$ where } m=lcm(a,b)). \end{align*} $$ Proof First note that \(\gamma\) is well defined. Next, we want to show that \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism. Since we’re working on \(\mathbf{Z}_a\) and \(\mathbf{Z}_b\), then we want to show that \(\gamma(x+y) = \gamma(x) + \gamma(y)\). Observe that $$ \begin{align*} \gamma(x+y) &amp;= ([x+y]_a, [x+y]_b) \\ &amp;= ([x]_a + [y]_a, [x]_b, [y]_b) \\ &amp;= ([x]_a, [x]_b) + ([y]_a, [y]_b) \\ &amp;= \gamma(x) + \gamma(y) \\ \end{align*} $$ Next, we want to show that the kernel is the set of multiples of \(m\) so \(\ker(\gamma) = \mathbf{Z}m\) where \(m = lcm(a,b)\). By definition, $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\gamma) &amp;= \{x \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \gamma(x) = ([x]_a, [x]_b) = ([0]_a, [0]_b)\}. \end{align*} $$ In other words, we want \(x\) such that \(x \equiv 0 (\bmod a)\) and \(x \equiv 0 (\bmod b)\) divides \(x\). That is \(a\) divides \(x\) and \(b\) divides \(x\). This is the set of multiples of \(m\). Therefore $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\gamma) &amp;= \mathbf{Z}a \cap \mathbf{Z}b = \mathbf{Z}m. \end{align*} $$ where \(m = lcm(a,b) = \frac{ab}{gcd(a,b)}\). A New Homomorphism As a consequence of this, we will get an injective homomorphism from the quotient group \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}m\) which is \(\mathbf{Z}_m\) to \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) as follows $$ \begin{align*} \mathbf{Z}_m &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b \\ [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_a, [x]_b) \end{align*} $$ Why? Recall that we defined a homomorphism \(\gamma\) from \(\mathbf{Z}\) to \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\). Its kernel \(K = \mathbf{Z}m\). By the Homomorphism Theorem, we get another homomorphism from the quotient group \(\mathbf{Z}/K\) to the same target group \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\). Also recall that since \(\ker(\gamma) = K = \mathbf{Z}m\), then the new homomorphism is also injective. When will the homomorphism be surjective? Since it’s injective, then it suffices that to show that \(|\mathbf{Z}_m| = |\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b|\). So when will they have the same size? Theorem If \(a, b \geq 1\) and \(gcd(a,b) = 1\). Then we have an isomorphism $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_m &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b, \quad (m = ab)\\ [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_a, [x]_b) \end{align*} $$ Fact: the reverse, if \(gcd(a,b) &gt; 1\), then \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b \not\cong \mathbf{Z}_{ab}\). Chinese Remainder Theorem The previous theorem is in fact the Chinese Remainder Theorem but the Chinese Remainder Theorem is stated in terms of modular arithmetic. Theorem If \(a, b \geq 1\), \(gcd(a,b) = 1\) and \(m = ab\). Then for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbf{Z}\), there exists \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\) such that $$ \begin{align*} x \equiv \alpha &amp;(\bmod a) \\ x \equiv \beta &amp;(\bmod b) \end{align*} $$ Furthermore, any two such \(x\) are congruent modulo \(m\). So now we can generalize our previous theorem to Theorem If \(a_1, a_2, ... a_r \geq 1\) and \(gcd(a_i, a_j) = 1\) if \(i \neq j\). Then there is an isomorphism $$ \begin{align*} \mathbf{Z}_m &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_{a_1} \times \mathbf{Z}_{a_2} \times ... \mathbf{Z}_{a_r}\\ [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_{a_1}, [x]_{a_2},...,[x]_{a_r}) \end{align*} $$ where \(m = a_1a_2....a_r\). For example: \(\mathbf{Z}_{240} = \mathbf{Z}_{16} \times \mathbf{Z}_3 \times \mathbf{Z}_5\) The Multiplicative Group Recall \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) is not just a group but a ring with two operations addition and multiplication. Inside this ring, we can focus on the elements that have a multiplicative inverse and form \(\Phi(n) = \{u \in \mathbf{Z}_n \ |\) u has a multiplicative inverse \(\} \subseteq \mathbf{Z}_n\). \((\Phi(n),\cdot)\) is a group with the multiplication operation. This group is also abelian and is called “modular units”. It is not a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). It turns out that we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to decompose \(\Phi(n)\), the modular units group. Before listing the theorem recall that if \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\). Then \([x]_n \in \Phi(n)\) if and only if \(gcd(x,n)=1\). Theorem If \(a, b \geq 1\), \(gcd(a, b) = 1\) and \(m = ab\). Then there is an isomorphism $$ \begin{align*} \Phi(m) &amp;\rightarrow \Phi(a) \times \Phi(b) \\ [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_{a}, [x]_{b}) \end{align*} $$ Proof Recall the isomorphism we established earlier $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_m &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b \\ [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_{a}, [x]_{b}) \end{align*} $$ This worked with addition. But it is also compatible with multiplication. We didn’t define multiplication on ordered pairs. So define it as follows. $$ \begin{align*} (u_1, v_1) \cdot (u_2, v_2) = (u_1u_2, v_1v_2) \end{align*} $$ where \(u_1, u_2 \in \mathbf{Z}_a\) and \(v_1,v_2 \in \mathbf{Z}_b\). The two operations (addition and multiplication) make \(R = \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) a ring. We have two claims: Claim 1: \(\gamma(xy) = ([xy]_a, [xy]_b)\) This is true because we know \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism. So $$ \begin{align*} \gamma(xy)=\gamma(x)\gamma(y) &amp;= ([x]_a, [x]_b)\cdot ([y]_a, [y]_b) \\ &amp;= ([x]_a[y]_a, [x]_b[y]_b) \\ &amp;= ([xy]_a, [xy]_b). \end{align*} $$ Claim 2: The function \(\gamma\) restricts to a function $$ \begin{align*} \gamma' : \Phi(m) \rightarrow \Phi(a) \times \Phi(b) \end{align*} $$ which is a bijection. why? if \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\) such that \([x]_m \in \Phi(m)\), then we know that \(gcd(x,m) = 1\). We defined \(m = ab\). So if \(x\) is relatively prime to \(m\), then it must be relatively prime to the factors of \(m\), so \(gcd(x,b) = 1\). This means that \([x]_a \in \Phi(a)\) and \([x]_b \in \Phi(b)\). \(\gamma'\) is injective because \(\gamma\) is an injective function. \(\gamma'\) is surjective. \(\gamma\) is a bijection so every element of \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) has the form \([x]_a, [x]_b\) for some \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\). This means that \(gcd(x,a) = 1 = gcd(x, b)\). So \(gcd(x,ab) = 1\). Example: \(\Phi(30) \cong \Phi(6) \times \Phi(5) \cong \Phi(2) \times \Phi(3) \times \Phi(5)\). Then we can analyze each of these groups. So $$ \begin{align*} \Phi(5) &amp;\cong \{e\} \\ \Phi(5) &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}_2 \\ \Phi(5) &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}_4. \end{align*} $$ References MATH417 by Charles Rezk Algebra: Abstract and Concrete by Frederick M.

Correspondence Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup of \(G\). There is a bijection between \(B \leq G/N\) and the subgroup \(\pi^{-1}B\) (pre-image of \(B\) which is a subgroup of \(G\)).
$$
\begin{align*}
B \leq G/N \longrightarrow \pi^{-1}B
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Recall that we defined the quotient homomorphism to be</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi \ : \ G &amp;\rightarrow G/N \\ 
       \pi(x) &amp;= xN.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Also Recall the the pre-image of \(B\) is \(\pi^{-1}(B) = \{g \in G \ | \ \pi(g) \in B\}\) which we showed previously to be a subgroup of \(G\).
<br />
<br />
Additionally, the theorem also claims that the normal subgroups of \(G/N\) correspond to the normal subgroups in \(G\) containing \(N\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) and \(N = \mathbf{Z}6\) (multiples of 6). Therefore \(G/N = \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}6 = \mathbf{Z}_6\). Here is a breakdown of the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}\). Within all of these subgroups you’ll see the \(\mathbf{Z}6\). The subgroups in the red outline will correspond to the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}6 = \mathbf{Z}_6\) on the left side.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec17/2.png" width="90%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Take another example. Suppose that \(N = \mathbf{Z}2\). Recall the definition of \(\pi\):</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi \ : \ \mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow (\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2 = \mathbf{Z}_2) \\ 
       \pi(x) &amp;= x + \mathbf{Z}2.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>For example \(x = 3\) and \(x = 6\). Then</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi(3) = 3 + \mathbf{Z}2 &amp;= \{...,3 + -4, 3 + -2, 3 + 0, 3 + 2, 3 + 4,...\} \\
                          &amp;= \{..., -1, 1, 3, 5, 7...\} = [1]_2 \\
\pi(6) = 6 + \mathbf{Z}2 &amp;= \{...,6 + -4, 6 + -2, 6 + 0, 6 + 2, 6 + 4,...\}  \\
                          &amp;= \{...,2, 4, 6, 8, 10...\} = [0]_2
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>In general, we will have exactly two cosets. Again \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2\) partitions \(\mathbf{Z}\) into two cosets. The coset of the even numbers and the coset of the odd numbers.
<br />
<br />
Now, we want to take their pre-image. Here the possible subsets in \(\mathbf{Z}_2\) are \([0]_2\) and \([1]_2\). BUT, the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}_2\) are only \(\{[0]\}\) and \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). \([1]\) is NOT a subgroup. So \(B = \{\{[0]\}, \mathbf{Z}_2\}\) in</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi^{-1}(B) = \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in B\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Applying it on each subgroup, we see that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi^{-1}(\{[0]\}) &amp;= \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in \{[0]\}\} \\
              &amp;= \{-4, -2, 0, 2, 4,.... \} \\
			  &amp;= \mathbf{Z}2 \\
\pi^{-1}(\mathbf{Z}_2)  &amp;= \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in \mathbf{Z}_2\} \\
              &amp;= \mathbf{Z}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So we see here that there is a bijective correspondance between \(\{[0]\}\) which is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2 = \mathbf{Z}_2\) and \(\mathbf{Z}2\) which is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof of the Correspondence Theorem</b></h4>
<p>So again, we want to show that there is a bijection between the subgroup \(d\) of the quotient group \(G/N\) and the subgroup of \(G\) which contain \(N\)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec17/1.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>
<p>One way to show that there is a bijection is to show that we have an inverse function.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can send a subgroup of the quotient group \(B \leq G/N\) its pre-image \(\pi^{-1}(B)\). We can easily show that \(\pi^{-1}(B)\) is a subgroup of \(G\). Recall that \(B\) is a collection of cosets \(B = \{gN \ | gN \leq G/N\}\) because it's a subgroup of the quotient group. The pre-image of \(B\) are elements of \(G\) such that they're the elements that make up the cosets. So if \(B =\{eN, aN, bN\}\), then its pre-image is \(\{e, a,b\}\) which is a subgroup of \(G\). Note here that we must have the identity element \(eN \in B\) since it's a subgroup. So we can see here that \(N\) is definitely contained in \(G\).</li>
<li>To go the other way. Suppose we have a subgroup of \(A \leq G\) containing \(N\). Now, to relate it to a subgroup inside \(G/N\), take its image under \(\pi\). We know \(\pi(A)\) by definition are the cosets \(\{\pi(a)=aN \ | \ a \in A\}\). \(\pi(A)\) is a subgroup of \(G/N\).</li>
</ul>
<p>So now we need to check two things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If \(B \leq G/N\), then \(\pi(\pi^{-1}(B)) = B\).</li>
	<li>If \(A \leq G\), then \(\pi^{-1}(\pi(A)) = A\).</li>
</ul>
<p>Remark: If we don’t know that \(A\) contains \(N\), then if \(A \leq G\), we can show that \(\pi(\pi(A)) = AN = \{an \ | \ a, n \in N\}\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>General Correspondance Theorem</b></h4>
<p>There is a more general correspondance theorem (the way it is listed in the book) which says
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Correspondence Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(\varphi: G \rightarrow H\) is a surjective homomorphism and \(N = \ker(\phi)\). Then, there is a bijection correspondance between the subgroups of \(H\) and the subgroups of \(G\) which contain \(N\).
</div>
<p><br />
Recall that by the Isomorphism Theorem, that \(H \approx G/N\). By the previous Correspondance Theorem, we showed that subgroups of \(G/N\) correspond to subgroups of \(G\) containing \(N\). So we’ll have this picture</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec17/3.png" width="100%" class="center" /></p>
<p>So we have \(H \approx G/N\) by the Isomorphism Theorem and then we have the second part of the picture by the Correspondance Theorem.
<br />
<br /></p>

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Factorization Theorem</b></h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Factorization Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(N \leq K \leq G\) where \(N\) and \(K\) are normal subgroups in \(G\). Define the surjective homomorphism
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi \ : \ G/N &amp;\rightarrow G/K \\
             xN &amp;\rightarrow xK
\end{align*}
$$
So this homomorphism takes the \(N\) coset of \(x\) to the \(K\) coset of \(x\). From this, we get an isomorphism between \((G/N) / (K/N)\) and \(G/K\) so \((G/N) / (K/N) \approx G/K\) where \(\ker(\varphi) = K/N\).
</div>
<p><br />
Note here that the kernel \(K/N\) is a subgroup of \(G/N\). The kernel consists of all the cosets in \(G/N\) such that if we apply the homomorphism, we get the identity coset in \(G/K\). In fact (show this (Exercise))</p>
<div>

<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group with subsets \(A, B \subseteq G\). Then

If \(A\) and \(B\) are subgroups of \(G\), then we can have \(AB \neq BA\). We can also have \(AB\) and \(BA\) not be subgroups themselves.

<p>We can observe that \(AB\) is not a subgroup of \(G\) because it is not closed. Another reason is that the order of \(AB\) is 4 while the group size \(|S_3| = 6\) and 4 doesn’t divide 6. \(BA\) is also not a subgroup since it has 4 elements. This leads to the next proposition.

Recall that if \(G\) is a group and \(N\) was a normal subgroup of \(G\). And then we had a homomorphism \(\varphi: G \rightarrow H\) such that the kernel of \(\phi\) is contained in \(N\) (or easier to remember, \(\phi(N) = \{e\}\)). Then we get $$ \begin{align*} \varphi':G/N &amp;\rightarrow H \\ \phi'(xn) &amp;= \phi(x) \end{align*} $$ Then we studied the Isomorphism Theorem which requires additionally that the homomorphism \(\varphi:G \rightarrow H\) to be surjective as well as \(N = \ker(\varphi)\). Then, this will then get us an isomorphism \(\varphi': G/N \rightarrow H\). The Correspondence Theorem relates the subgroups of the quotient group \(G/N\) to the subgroups of \(G\) that contain \(N\). The theorem claims that there is a bijection or a bijective correspondance between the two groups. Correspondence Theorem Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup of \(G\). There is a bijection between \(B \leq G/N\) and the subgroup \(\pi^{-1}B\) (pre-image of \(B\) which is a subgroup of \(G\)). $$ \begin{align*} B \leq G/N \longrightarrow \pi^{-1}B \end{align*} $$ Recall that we defined the quotient homomorphism to be $$ \begin{align*} \pi \ : \ G &amp;\rightarrow G/N \\ \pi(x) &amp;= xN. \end{align*} $$ Also Recall the the pre-image of \(B\) is \(\pi^{-1}(B) = \{g \in G \ | \ \pi(g) \in B\}\) which we showed previously to be a subgroup of \(G\). Additionally, the theorem also claims that the normal subgroups of \(G/N\) correspond to the normal subgroups in \(G\) containing \(N\). Example Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) and \(N = \mathbf{Z}6\) (multiples of 6). Therefore \(G/N = \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}6 = \mathbf{Z}_6\). Here is a breakdown of the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}\). Within all of these subgroups you’ll see the \(\mathbf{Z}6\). The subgroups in the red outline will correspond to the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}6 = \mathbf{Z}_6\) on the left side. Take another example. Suppose that \(N = \mathbf{Z}2\). Recall the definition of \(\pi\): $$ \begin{align*} \pi \ : \ \mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow (\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2 = \mathbf{Z}_2) \\ \pi(x) &amp;= x + \mathbf{Z}2. \end{align*} $$ For example \(x = 3\) and \(x = 6\). Then $$ \begin{align*} \pi(3) = 3 + \mathbf{Z}2 &amp;= \{...,3 + -4, 3 + -2, 3 + 0, 3 + 2, 3 + 4,...\} \\ &amp;= \{..., -1, 1, 3, 5, 7...\} = [1]_2 \\ \pi(6) = 6 + \mathbf{Z}2 &amp;= \{...,6 + -4, 6 + -2, 6 + 0, 6 + 2, 6 + 4,...\} \\ &amp;= \{...,2, 4, 6, 8, 10...\} = [0]_2 \end{align*} $$ In general, we will have exactly two cosets. Again \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2\) partitions \(\mathbf{Z}\) into two cosets. The coset of the even numbers and the coset of the odd numbers. Now, we want to take their pre-image. Here the possible subsets in \(\mathbf{Z}_2\) are \([0]_2\) and \([1]_2\). BUT, the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}_2\) are only \(\{[0]\}\) and \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). \([1]\) is NOT a subgroup. So \(B = \{\{[0]\}, \mathbf{Z}_2\}\) in $$ \begin{align*} \pi^{-1}(B) = \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in B\} \end{align*} $$ Applying it on each subgroup, we see that $$ \begin{align*} \pi^{-1}(\{[0]\}) &amp;= \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in \{[0]\}\} \\ &amp;= \{-4, -2, 0, 2, 4,.... \} \\ &amp;= \mathbf{Z}2 \\ \pi^{-1}(\mathbf{Z}_2) &amp;= \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in \mathbf{Z}_2\} \\ &amp;= \mathbf{Z} \end{align*} $$ So we see here that there is a bijective correspondance between \(\{[0]\}\) which is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2 = \mathbf{Z}_2\) and \(\mathbf{Z}2\) which is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}\). Proof of the Correspondence Theorem So again, we want to show that there is a bijection between the subgroup \(d\) of the quotient group \(G/N\) and the subgroup of \(G\) which contain \(N\) One way to show that there is a bijection is to show that we have an inverse function. We can send a subgroup of the quotient group \(B \leq G/N\) its pre-image \(\pi^{-1}(B)\). We can easily show that \(\pi^{-1}(B)\) is a subgroup of \(G\). Recall that \(B\) is a collection of cosets \(B = \{gN \ | gN \leq G/N\}\) because it's a subgroup of the quotient group. The pre-image of \(B\) are elements of \(G\) such that they're the elements that make up the cosets. So if \(B =\{eN, aN, bN\}\), then its pre-image is \(\{e, a,b\}\) which is a subgroup of \(G\). Note here that we must have the identity element \(eN \in B\) since it's a subgroup. So we can see here that \(N\) is definitely contained in \(G\). To go the other way. Suppose we have a subgroup of \(A \leq G\) containing \(N\). Now, to relate it to a subgroup inside \(G/N\), take its image under \(\pi\). We know \(\pi(A)\) by definition are the cosets \(\{\pi(a)=aN \ | \ a \in A\}\). \(\pi(A)\) is a subgroup of \(G/N\). So now we need to check two things: If \(B \leq G/N\), then \(\pi(\pi^{-1}(B)) = B\). If \(A \leq G\), then \(\pi^{-1}(\pi(A)) = A\). Remark: If we don’t know that \(A\) contains \(N\), then if \(A \leq G\), we can show that \(\pi(\pi(A)) = AN = \{an \ | \ a, n \in N\}\) General Correspondance Theorem There is a more general correspondance theorem (the way it is listed in the book) which says Correspondence Theorem Let \(\varphi: G \rightarrow H\) is a surjective homomorphism and \(N = \ker(\phi)\). Then, there is a bijection correspondance between the subgroups of \(H\) and the subgroups of \(G\) which contain \(N\). Recall that by the Isomorphism Theorem, that \(H \approx G/N\). By the previous Correspondance Theorem, we showed that subgroups of \(G/N\) correspond to subgroups of \(G\) containing \(N\). So we’ll have this picture So we have \(H \approx G/N\) by the Isomorphism Theorem and then we have the second part of the picture by the Correspondance Theorem. Factorization Theorem Factorization Theorem Let \(N \leq K \leq G\) where \(N\) and \(K\) are normal subgroups in \(G\). Define the surjective homomorphism $$ \begin{align*} \varphi \ : \ G/N &amp;\rightarrow G/K \\ xN &amp;\rightarrow xK \end{align*} $$ So this homomorphism takes the \(N\) coset of \(x\) to the \(K\) coset of \(x\). From this, we get an isomorphism between \((G/N) / (K/N)\) and \(G/K\) so \((G/N) / (K/N) \approx G/K\) where \(\ker(\varphi) = K/N\). Note here that the kernel \(K/N\) is a subgroup of \(G/N\). The kernel consists of all the cosets in \(G/N\) such that if we apply the homomorphism, we get the identity coset in \(G/K\). In fact (show this (Exercise)) $$ \begin{align*} K/N = \{xN \ | \ \varphi(xN) = ek\} = \{xN \ | \ xN \leq K\} \end{align*} $$ Product Subsets Definition (Product Subsets) Let \(G\) be a group with subsets \(A, B \subseteq G\). Then $$ \begin{align*} AB &amp;= \{ab \ | \ a \in A, b \in B\} \subseteq G \\ BA &amp;= \{ba \ | \ b \in B, a \in A \} \subseteq G. \end{align*} $$ If \(A\) and \(B\) are subgroups of \(G\), then we can have \(AB \neq BA\). We can also have \(AB\) and \(BA\) not be subgroups themselves. Example Suppose \(G = S_3\). Then $$ \begin{align*} A &amp;= \langle (1 \ 2) \rangle = \{e, (1 \ 2)\} \\ B &amp;= \langle (1 \ 3) \rangle = \{e, (1 \ 3)\}. \end{align*} $$ Then $$ \begin{align*} AB &amp;= \{e, (1 \ 2), (1 \ 3), (1 \ 3 \ 2)\} \\ BA &amp;= \{e, (1 \ 3), (1 \ 2), (1 \ 2 \ 3)\}. \end{align*} $$ We can observe that \(AB\) is not a subgroup of \(G\) because it is not closed. Another reason is that the order of \(AB\) is 4 while the group size \(|S_3| = 6\) and 4 doesn’t divide 6. \(BA\) is also not a subgroup since it has 4 elements. This leads to the next proposition. Proposition If \(A, B \leq G\), then \(AB\) is a subgroup if and only if \(AB = BA\). Proof \(\Rightarrow:\) Suppose that \(AB\) is a subgroup of \(G\). We want to show that \(AB = BA\). Let \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\). So \(x = ab \in AB\). But \(AB\) is a subgroup, so \(x^{-1} \in AB\). We can write \(x^{-1} = a'b'\) where \(a' \in A\) and \(b' \in B\). Take the inverse of \(x^{-1}\) to see that $$ \begin{align*} (x^{-1})^{-1} &amp;= (a'b')^{-1} \\ x &amp;= (b')^{-1}(a')^{-1} \\ \end{align*} $$ But this shows that \((b')^{-1}(a')^{-1} \in BA\). This implies that \(AB \subseteq BA\). Now, suppose that \(x \in BA\). So \(x = ba\) where \(b \in B\) and \(a \in A\). Write \(ba = (eb)(ae)\). We know that \(eb \in AB\) and \(ea \in AB\), so \((eb)(ae)\) must be in \(AB\) since \(AB\) is a subgroup. So \(BA \subseteq AB\). This proves that \(AB = BA\) as we wanted to show. \(\Leftarrow:\) Now suppose that \(AB = BA\). We want to show that \(AB\) is a subgroup of \(G\). \(e \in AB\). This is because \(e \in A\) and \(e \in B\) so \(ee = e \in AB\). \(x, y \in AB\) implies that \(xy \in AB\). Suppose that \(a,a' \in A\) and \(b,b' \in B\). Then \(aba'b' = a(ba')b'\). \(ba' \in AB = BA\) by the hypothesis. So we can re-write \(ba'\) as \(a''b''\) for some \(a'' \in A\) and \(b'' \in B\). So now \(a(ba')b' = aa''b''b \in AB\) For Any \(x \in AB\), \(x^{-1} \in AB\). If \(x \in AB\), then \(x \in BA\) by the hypothesis. So write \(x = ba\) so \(x^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}\). This means that \(x^{-1} \in AB\). Diamond Isomorphism Theorem Diamond Isomorphism Theorem If \(A, N \leq G\) where \(N\) is normal, then \(AN = NA\). \(AN \leq G\). \(N\) is normal in \(AN\). \(A \cap N \leq A\), \(A \cap N\) is normal in \(A\). \(A/N \approx A/A \cap N\).

Homomorphism Theorem

Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup. Let \(\pi: G \rightarrow G/N\) be a homomorphism and let \(\phi : G \rightarrow H\) be a homomorphism.<br /> 
Let \(K = ker(\phi)\) be a normal subgroup such that \(N \subseteq K\). Then <br />

<p><br />
In a picture, once we have the requirement \(N \subseteq K\) where \(K = ker(\phi)\), then we get this homomorphism \(\varphi'\) between \(H\) and \(G/N\). This new homomorphism \(\phi'\) is unique.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec16/1.png" width="90%" class="center" /></p>

<p>In short, we’re following a recipe to construct a homomorphism. Given a homomorphism \(\varphi \ : \ G \rightarrow H\) and a normal subgroup \(N\) that is a subset of \(ker(\varphi) = K\) (which means that \(\varphi(N) = \{e\}\) since every element in the kernel is sent to the identity). THEN, we get another homomorphism \(\varphi\) from \(G/N\) to \(H\). The homomorphism is given by \(\varphi'(aN) = \varphi(a)\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>(1) First we need to check that \(\varphi'\) is well defined. This means that want to show that if \(aN = bN\) (in \(G/N\)), then \(\varphi'(a) = \varphi'(b)\) which is \(\varphi(a) = \varphi(b)\) in \(H\) by how we defined \(\varphi'\) above. Re-write \(aN = bN\) as</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    aN &amp;= bN \\
	b^{-1}aN &amp;= N.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So \(b^{-1}a \in N\). Now we can apply \(\varphi\) on it to get</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    \varphi(b^{-1}a) &amp;= \varphi(b^{-1})(a) \quad \text{(since $\varphi$ is a homomorphism)} \\
    e &amp;= \varphi(b^{-1})(a) \quad \text{(since $N \subseteq K$)} \\
    \varphi(b) &amp;= (a).
	
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So it’s well defined as we wanted to show. \(\blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
(2) Next, we want to show that it is a homomorphism. To see that observe that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    \varphi'(aN \cdot bN) &amp;= \varphi(abN) \quad \text{(def of quotient function)} \\
	                      &amp;= \varphi(ab) \quad \text{(def of $\varphi'$)} \\
						  &amp;= \varphi(a)\varphi(b) \quad \text{(def of a homomorphism)} \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>On the other hand</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    \varphi'(aN)\varphi'(bN) &amp;= \varphi(a)\varphi(b) \quad \text{(def of $\varphi'$)} \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>And so we’re done. \(\blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
(3) Finally, we need to prove the conclusions of the theorem. The second statements claims that \(\phi'(G/N) = \phi(G)\). But this is true by how we defined \(\varphi'\). For the first statement which claims that \(ker(\varphi') = K/N = \{aN \ | \ aN \subseteq K\}\). First, we know that by the definition of the kernel that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    ker(\varphi') &amp;= \{aN \ | \ \varphi'(aN) = e_H \} \\
	              &amp;= \{aN \ | \ \varphi(a) = e_H \} \quad \text{(by def of $\varphi'$)} \\
				  &amp;= \{aN \ | \ a \in ker(\phi) = K \} \quad \text{($\varphi(a)=e$ so $a$ is in the kernel)} 
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Notice now that \(N\) is a subgroup of \(K\). This means that any coset of \(N\) will be contained in the corresponding coset of \(K\) so \(aN \subseteq aK\). But here it is the trivial coset so \(aK = eK = K\).

<h4><b>Isomorphism Theorem</b></h4>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Isomorphism Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup. Let \(\pi: G \rightarrow G/N\) be a homomorphism and let \(\phi : G \rightarrow H\) be a <b>surjective</b> homomorphism.<br /> 
Let \(K = ker(\phi)\) be a normal subgroup such that \(N = K\) (unlike before where \(N \subseteq K\)). Then <br />
There there is a isomorphism \(\varphi': G/N \rightarrow H\) with formula (same as before)
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi'(aN) = \varphi(a)
\end{align*}
$$
Unlike before, now \(\phi'(G/N) = H\) and the kernel \(ker(\varphi') = \{eN\}\) (the trivial coset of \(N\)).
</div>
<p><br />
So we have the same conditions as before except that \(N = K\) and the \(\phi\) is surjective. So we can apply the homomorphism theorem from before and we’ll get the same results as before. That is, a homomorphism \(\phi'\). But now since \(\phi\) is surjective and its image is the same as the image of \(\phi'\), then \(\phi'\) is also surjective. 
<br />
<br />
Moreover, its kernel per the homomorphism theorem is \(\{aN \ | \ aN \subseteq K\}\) (collection of all cosets of \(N\) that are contained in \(K\)). But now \(N = K\). There is only one coset of \(N\) contained in \(N\) which is the trivial coset \(eN\). so \(ker(\phi') = \{eN\}\). This implies that \(\phi'\) is injective. So \(\phi'\) is now a bijection which means that it’s an isomorphism.

<ul>
<li>Let \(H = \langle a \rangle\) be a finite cyclic group of order \(n\). </li>
<li>Let \(G = (\mathbf{Z}, +)\). </li>
<li>Let \(N = \mathbf{Z}n \unlhd \mathbf{Z}\) the group of multiples of \(n\) which is a subgroup of \(G = \mathbf{Z}\).</li>
<li>Let \(\phi: \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow H \) be a surjective homomorphism by the formula \(\phi(m) = a^m\)</li>
<li>The kernel of \(\phi\) is \(ker(\phi) = \{m \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ a^m = e\}\). The kernel is the set of all the multiples of the order of \(\langle a \rangle\) so it's \(\mathbf{Z}n\) where \(n\) is the order.</li>

<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Let \(\mathbf{F}^{x} = \mathbf{F} \ \{0\}\). </li>
<li>Let \(GL_n(\mathbf{F}) = \{ A \in Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbf{F})\) such that \(A\) is invertible\(\}\) with matrix multiplication. </li>
<li>Let \(\phi: GL_n(\mathbf{F}) \rightarrow \mathbf{F}^{x} \) be a homomorphism by the formula \(\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)\). Is the determinant surjective? for any number \(a \in \mathbf{F}\), can we find a matrix satisfying such that its determinant is \(a\)? Yes! consider
$$
\begin{align*}
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; 0 &amp; ... &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; ... &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\

$$
The determinant of this matrix is \(a\). So this homomorphism is surjective.
</li>
<li>The kernel of \(\phi\) is the set of invertible matrices such that their determinant is the identity matrix. \(ker(\phi) = \{A \in GL_n(F) \ | \ \det(a) = 1\}\). This set is called the special linear group or \(SL_n(\mathbf{F})\) In fact it is a normal subgroup of \(GL_n(F)\).</li>

<p>The Isomorphism Theorem tells us that \(GL_n(\mathbf{F})/SL_n(\mathbf{F})\) is isomorphic to  \(\mathbf{F}^{x}\)

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 3</b></h4>
<p>We’re going to show that \(S_4 / N \approx S_3\). 
<br />
<br />
To do this, we’re going to produce a homomorphism from \(S_4\) to \(S_3\). But \(S_3\) is isomorphic to \(Sym(X)\) where \(X\) has 3 elements.
<br />
<br />
\(S_4\) is the set of permutations of a 4 element set. There is a trick that we can use to construct interesting homomorphisms out of a permutation group which is to find structures on the set that we’re permuting. For example define \(X\) to be the set of partitions of \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\) into two disjoint subsets of 2 each. So</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
   &amp;\quad \ \quad S_1 \quad \quad S_2 \quad \quad S_3 \\
X &amp;= \{12|34, 13|24, 14|23\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So we have 3 different ways of grouping these 4 elements. Suppose now we have a permutation in \(S_4\) as follows</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So now let’s apply \(g\) on the three elements in \(X\)</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
S_1 &amp;= 12|34 \xrightarrow{g} 23|14 = 14|23 = S_3 \\
S_2 &amp;= 13|24 \xrightarrow{g} 21|34 = 12|34 = S_1 \\
S_3 &amp;= 14|23 \xrightarrow{g} 24|31 = 13|24 = S_2.
\end{align*}

<p>So for the first example, we’re given \(12|34\). We’ll look up where each element goes in \(g\). For example 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3, 3 goes 1 and 4 stays fixed. So that’s exactly what we get which is \(S_3\).
<br />
<br />
So the permutation \(g\) sends \(S_1\) to \(S_3\), \(S_2\) to \(S_1\) and \(S_3\) to \(S_2\).</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}

\xrightarrow{\varphi}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Let’s now take another permutation \(g'\) in \(S_4\)</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g' = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
3 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So now let’s apply \(g'\) on the three elements in \(X\)</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
S_1 &amp;= 12|34 \xrightarrow{g} 21|43 = 12|23 = S_1 \\
S_2 &amp;= 13|24 \xrightarrow{g} 31|42 = 13|24 = S_2 \\
S_3 &amp;= 14|23 \xrightarrow{g} 41|32 = 14|23 = S_3.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So \(g'\) just takes \(X\) to itself</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
3 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}

\xrightarrow{\varphi}

\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
=
id \in S_3
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So here are some claims about \(\varphi\)</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(\varphi\) is a homomorphism from \(S_4\) to \(S_3\).</li>
	<li>\(\varphi\) is surjective. Recall that \(|S_4| = 24\) while \(|S_3| = 6\). (We still need to check (homework))</li>
	<li>\(K = ker(\phi)\) is a normal subgroup of \(S_4\). We can further deduce the order of \(K\). How? We know by the Isomorphism Theorem that the quotient group \(S_4/K\) is isomorphic \(S_3\) because \(\varphi\) is a surjective homomorphism and \(K\) is a normal subgroup. This tells us that these two groups have the same size. Since \(K\) is normal, we also know that the quotient group is the number of cosets. But by Lagrange's Theorem we know that \(\frac{|S_4|}{|K|}\) is equal to the number of cosets. So \(\frac{|S_4|}{|K|} = |S_4/K| = |S_3|\). Therefore, we see that \(|K| = 4\).</li>
	<li>In fact \(K = \{e, (1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 4)(2 \ 3), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4)\} \)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice here that we first proved that \(|K| = 4\) before finding the elements in \(K\). It’s just easier to verify that some element is in the kernel rather than finding the elements first.

<h4><b>Example 4</b></h4>
<p>Suppose that \(n \geq 3\). Let \(D_{2n}\) be the symmetries of regular \(2n\)-gon (even number of vertices.)<br /> 
We already know that if we have a symmetry of an \(n-\)gon, we get a permutation of its vertices. But there are other ways to construct a homomorphism. Consider the following homomorphism</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi \ : \ D_{2n} \rightarrow Sym(X) \approx S_n
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>where \(X\) be the set of diagonals of the polygon. For example, for \(n = 3\), we have 6 vertices. But we let’s think of the diagonals. We have 3 diagonals. Notice here that any symmetry will take a diagonal to another diagonal. If we label the diagonals, then a rotation will take diagonal 1 to diagonal 2 for example and diagonal 2 to diagonal 3 as shown below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec16/2.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>In fact, this homomorphism is surjective.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi \ : \ D_{6} \rightarrow S_3
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>The kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup of \(D_6\) and by the Isomorphism Theorem, the quotient group \(D_6/K\) is isomorphic to \(S_3\). How big is \(K\)? \(D_6\) has 12 elements and \(S_3\) has 6 elements. So \(K\) must have \(2\) elements. The kernel is \(\{e, r^3\}\).
