As the user types, we want to display the strings that the user might have intended to type. For example, if the user types “cas”, we might want to display the words “cast” and “castro” to the user. Formally, given strings of total length and a string (pattern) of length . We want to find all the strings that start with . The simplest solution would be to look at all strings and compare each string with the pattern we have. This will take time. However, suppose that we now we have patterns, then this approach will take time which is really slow. Similar to the RMQ notation, for the previous approach, we will write where is the preprocessing time and is the query time. So how can we make it faster? 2 The Trie Data Structure The trie (pronounced “try”) data structure is an efficient data structure that can help us achieve a faster running time when searching for keys. In the picture above, we can form the following words (words end with colored nodes): cake, cakes, cat, civil and cider. Let’s start with studying some properties of tries: &lt;&gt; Each node indicates whether it is the end of a valid word or not. In the above example, colored nodes represent the end of valid words. We can simply use a bool value (yes/no) in each node to do this. &lt;&gt; Each node will have children/edges where is the alphabet size. &lt;&gt; Edges represent letters. For example, the root node has one edge () to the nodes below. &lt;&gt; Each node also has only one parent. Let’s look at what a trie really looks like: You can see above, the root has only one edge of value . From , we can traverse to either or . From we can traverse to or . From we can traverse to or and so on. 2 Node and Edges Representation This can be done in many ways. The following is just one way that uses a struct to represent a node. This struct will include a bool value to indicate whether we have arrived at a valid word or not. Each node/struct will also have an array to store all possible edges. Each array position holds a pointer to a node struct, intially all set to NULL. Here, we will consider the English alphabet which consists of 26 letters. We will use position 0 to represent ‘a’, 1 to represent ‘b’ and so. We will take advantage of the fact that the ascii value for the letter a is 97 and z is 122 and so to store ‘c’, we simply find the right position in the array by subtracting ‘a’ (97) from ‘c’ (99) to get 2 which is the correct position for ‘c’. #define SIZE 26 typedef struct node { bool marker; // this is to indicate if it&#39;s the end of a valid word int value; // we&#39;ll use this to keep track of the number of possible matches at this node struct node *children[SIZE] = {NULL}; // 26 possible edges, edges represent letters in a trie } node; // a trie consists of a a root node and that&#39;s about it typedef struct trie { node *root; trie() { root = new node(); } 3 Prefix Search How do we search for prefixes now? given a pattern we want to output all possible matches. We just traverse down the root and keep matching until we reach the last character of the prefix we’re searching. If we want an exact match then we check if the node has a marker to indicate that it ends a valid word and return true if it does. But if we want to print all possible matches then we can take this node we’re currently on and then just do a simple depth first search down every branch to collect every possible word. Let’s look at search first: // return NULL if the pattern doesn&#39;t exist, otherwise // return the node we reached last (should have the pattern&#39;s last letter) node* search(std::string word) { long m = word.length(); node *current = root; // search for word in the tree rooted at root for (int i = 0; i &lt; m; i++) { // find the correct location for letter word[i] int index = word[i] - &#39;a&#39;; if (!current-&gt;children[index]) { // null pointer return NULL; // not found } // follow that link current = current-&gt;children[index]; } return current; } Search is simple. We just traverse down the root and stop when we’re done matching every character in the prefix. We will then return that last node. This takes time only. Next, we’ll look at word_with_prefix: // prefix match: print all possible matches int words_with_prefix(std::string prefix) { node *current = search(prefix); if (current == NULL) { // no matches return 0; } // right now, current has the last letter of the prefix // any valid word that comes after is a possible match // we want to return all of them, we use a queue for that std::queue&lt;std::string&gt; q; collect(current, prefix, q); while (!q.empty()) { printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, q.front().c_str()); q.pop(); } return current-&gt;value; // total matches } Here, we utilize search to find the prefix (returns the last node in the prefix) and then pass a queue to collect which will fill the queue with all matches. Next we’ll look at collect: // collect matches recursively from all branches // save them in q void collect(node *current, std::string prefix, std::queue&lt;std::string&gt; &amp;q) { if (current == NULL) { return; } if (current-&gt;marker) { q.push(prefix); } for (int i = 0; i &lt; SIZE; i++) { if (current-&gt;children[i] != NULL) { char c = i + &#39;a&#39;; collect(current-&gt;children[i], prefix + c, q); } } } Collect perform a depth first search on the tree rooted at current. As we go down each path, we will collect the characters in the string prefix. Once we’re at a leaf node and its value (marker) is not 0, meaning it’s a valid word, then we will push it on the queue. 4 Insert To insert a key we follow a similar process. We start at the root and we also start at the beginning of the key to be inserted. If the letter we’re on has already a link in the root then we follow it a long and move to the next letter as well. If the link is null then we create a new node for that letter. void insert(std::string word) { if (search(word)) { // word exists return; } int length = (int) word.length(); node *current = root; current-&gt;value++; // increment word count for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) { int index = word[i] - &#39;a&#39;; if (!current-&gt;children[index]) { // this letter doesn&#39;t exist, create it current-&gt;children[index] = new node(); } // this letter has a link already, follow it along current = current-&gt;children[index]; current-&gt;value++; } // mark the last node, this is the end of our word // this is a marker of an end to a valid word current-&gt;marker = true; } So insert takes time as well! 5 Delete To be added. 6 Longest Prefix To be added 7 Running Time We mentioned above that insert and search both take time where is the length of the pattern. How long does it take to build a trie to represent all words of total length ? We need to make insertions each of which will take size of each word. Since the total length of all words is , then the total time is which happens only once initially. Therefore, in the RMQ notation we will have which is a lot better than the naive solution. 8 Full Implementation: https://github.com/strncat/algorithms-and-data-structures/tree/master/strings/trie.cpp" />

<b>1 Introduction</b>
<br />
<img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/trie/intro.png" width="100%" />
Consider the following problem: a user is typing a string (call it <script type="math/tex">p</script>) of length <script type="math/tex">n</script> in a search engine. As the user types, we want to display the strings that the user might have intended to type. For example, if the user types “cas”, we might want to display  the words “cast” and “castro” to the user.
<br /><br />
Formally, given <script type="math/tex">k</script> strings of total length <script type="math/tex">m</script> and a string (pattern) <script type="math/tex">p</script> of length <script type="math/tex">n</script>. We want to find all the strings that start with <script type="math/tex">p</script>. The simplest solution would be to look at all strings and compare each string with the pattern we have. This will take <script type="math/tex">O(m)</script> time. However, suppose that we now we have <script type="math/tex">r</script> patterns, then this approach will take <script type="math/tex">O(mr)</script> time which is really slow. Similar to the RMQ notation, for the previous approach, we will write <script type="math/tex">\langle O(1), O(mr)\rangle</script> where <script type="math/tex">O(1)</script> is the preprocessing time and <script type="math/tex">O(mr)</script> is the query time. So how can we make it faster?

&lt;&gt; Each node indicates whether it is the end of a valid word or not. In the above example, colored nodes represent the end of valid words. We can simply use a bool value (yes/no) in each node to do this.<br />
&lt;&gt; Each node will have <script type="math/tex">R</script> children/edges where <script type="math/tex">R</script> is the alphabet size. <br />
&lt;&gt; Edges represent letters. For example, the root node has one edge (<script type="math/tex">c</script>) to the nodes below.<br />
&lt;&gt; Each node also has only one parent.<br />
<br />
Let’s look at what a trie really looks like:
<br />
<img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/trie/2.png" width="100%" />
You can see above, the root has only one edge of value <script type="math/tex">c</script>. From <script type="math/tex">c</script>, we can traverse to either <script type="math/tex">a</script> or <script type="math/tex">i</script>. From <script type="math/tex">a</script> we can traverse to <script type="math/tex">k</script> or <script type="math/tex">t</script>. From <script type="math/tex">i</script> we can traverse to <script type="math/tex">d</script> or <script type="math/tex">v</script> and so on.
<br />

<b>2 Node and Edges Representation</b>
<br />
<br />
This can be done in many ways. The following is just one way that uses a struct to represent a node. This struct will include a bool value to indicate whether we have arrived at a valid word or not. Each node/struct will also have an array to store all possible edges. Each array position holds a pointer to a node struct, intially all set to NULL. Here, we will consider the English alphabet which consists of 26 letters. We will use position 0 to represent ‘a’, 1 to represent ‘b’ and so. We will take advantage of the fact that the ascii value for the letter a is 97 and z is 122 and so to store ‘c’, we simply find the right position in the array by subtracting ‘a’ (97) from ‘c’ (99) to get 2 which is the correct position for ‘c’.</p>

<b>3 Prefix Search</b>
<br />
<br />
How do we search for prefixes now? given a pattern <script type="math/tex">p</script> we want to output all possible matches. We just traverse down the root and keep matching until we reach the last character of the prefix we’re searching. If we want an exact match then we check if the node has a marker to indicate that it ends a valid word and return true if it does. But if we want to print all possible matches then we can take this node we’re currently on and then just do a simple depth first search down every branch to collect every possible word.
<br />
<br />
Let’s look at search first:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="c1">// return NULL if the pattern doesn't exist, otherwise </span>
<span class="c1">// return the node we reached last (should have the pattern's last letter)</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">current</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><br />
Search is simple. We just traverse down the root and stop when we’re done matching every character in the prefix. We will then return that last node. This takes <script type="math/tex">O(n)</script> time only. Next, we’ll look at word_with_prefix:
<br />
<br /></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="c1">// prefix match: print all possible matches</span>

<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><br />
Here, we utilize <b>search</b> to find the prefix (returns the last node in the prefix) and then pass a queue to <b>collect</b> which will fill the queue with all matches. Next we’ll look at collect:
<br />
<br /></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="c1">// collect matches recursively from all branches</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>

<p><br />
<b>Collect</b> perform a depth first search on the tree rooted at current. As we go down each path, we will collect the characters in the string prefix. Once we’re at a leaf node and its value (marker) is not 0, meaning it’s a valid word, then we will push it on the queue.
<br />
<br />

<p><br />
<b>4 Insert</b>
<br />
<br />
To insert a key we follow a similar process. We start at the root and we also start at the beginning of the key to be inserted. If the letter we’re on has already a link in the root then we follow it a long and move to the next letter as well. If the link is null then we create a new node for that letter.

<b>7 Running Time</b>
<br />
<br />
We mentioned above that insert and search both take <script type="math/tex">O(n)</script> time where <script type="math/tex">n</script> is the length of the pattern. How long does it take to build a trie to represent all words of total length <script type="math/tex">m</script>? We need to make <script type="math/tex">k</script> insertions each of which will take <script type="math/tex">O(</script>size of each word<script type="math/tex">)</script>. Since the total length of all words is <script type="math/tex">m</script>, then the total time is <script type="math/tex">O(m)</script> which happens only once initially. Therefore, in the RMQ notation we will have <script type="math/tex">\langle O(m), O(n) \rangle</script> which is a lot better than the naive solution.
