<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">
  <b>\(\sqrt{3}\) is an irrational number.</b>
</div>
<br>
<h3>Proof:</h3>
Suppose it is a rational number and let $$\sqrt{3} = \frac{p}{q}$$ where $$p$$ and $$q$$ are integers and $$q$$ is not zero. Furthermore, assume that the fraction is in its simplist form. Now we can square each side and simplify
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
(\sqrt{3})^2 &= \big(\frac{p}{q}\big)^2 \\
3 &= \frac{p^2}{q^2} \\
p^2 &= 3q^2. \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
From this we can conclude that $$p^2$$ is divisible by 3. But by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic $$a$$ is also divisble by 3. So let $$p = 3k$$ where $$k$$ is an integer. Let's plug in $$2k$$ back in the main equation and simplify
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
p^2 &= 3q^2 \\
(3k)^2 &= 3q^2 \\
9k^2 &= 3q^2 \\
3k^2 &= q^2 \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
But now $$q^2$$ is divisible by 3 which means that $$q$$ is divisible by 3 but this means that $$q$$ and $$p$$ must have 3 as a common factor. However, we said earlier that $$p^2/q^2$$ is in its simplest form. Therefore, this is a contradiction and $$\sqrt{3}$$ can not be a rational number.
