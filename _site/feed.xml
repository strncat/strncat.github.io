For the definitions of an upper bound and the least upper bound of a set. See <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">This</a>.
<br />
<br /></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \(A\) and \(B\) be sets and let \(A + B\) be the set defined above. We want to prove that \(\sup A+B = \sup A + \sup B\). To do this, we will prove:</p>
<ul> 
	<li>\(\sup (A+B) \leq \sup A + \sup B\).</li> 
	<li>\(\sup (A+B) \geq \sup A + \sup B\).</li>
</ul>
<p>From these two inequalities we will then conclude that \(\sup A+B = \sup A + \sup B\).
<br />
<br />
To prove that \(\sup A+B \leq \sup A + \sup B\), let \(a\) be an arbitrary element in \(A\). Then we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a &amp;\leq \sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Similarly, Let \(b\) be an arbitrary element in \(B\). Then we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
b &amp;\leq \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Adding both inequalities will result in</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a + b &amp;\leq \sup A + \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Since \(a\) and \(b\) were arbitrary, this means that \(\sup A + \sup B\) is an upper bound for \(A + B\). But we know the least upper bound for \(A+B\) is \(\sup A + B\) and by the definition of the least upper bound \(\sup A + B\) must be less than or equal to any other bound on \(A + B\). Therefore we can write,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup (A+B) &amp;\leq \sup A + \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>And this concludes the first part of the proof. To prove condition two, let \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\) be arbitrary elements. We know that by the definition of the least upper bound we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a + b &amp;\leq \sup (A + B).
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Let’s move \(b\) to the other side of the inequality.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - b.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>\(a\) here is an arbitrary element in \(A\) so \(\sup (A + B) - b\) must be an upper bound for \(A\) by the definition of an upper bound. But we know that \(\sup A\) is the least upper bound and the least upper bound is less than or equal to any other bound. Therefore, we can write,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup A &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - b.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We can move swap \(\sup A\) and \(b\) now to see that,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
b &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - \sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>With the same argument we used previously here we can see that \(\sup (A+B) - \sup A\) is an upper bound for \(B\) since \(b\) is arbitrary and we know that the least upper bound is less than or equal to any other bound. Therefore,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup B &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - \sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Re-arranging the terms gets us,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup A + \sup B &amp;\leq \sup (A + B).
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>as required. This concludes the second part of the proof. Therefore, \(\sup A + \sup B \leq \sup (A + B)\) as required.

<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \(A \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) be nonempty and bounded above, let \(c \in \mathbf{R}\) and let \(cA = \{ca : a \in A\}\). We’ll verify both conditions of the least upper bound. Let \(a \in A\). We know that \(a \leq \sup A\). Multiply both sides by \(c\) to get</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
ca \leq c\sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This means that \(c\sup A\) is an upper bound for \(cA\) and this verifies condition one. To verify condition two, let \(b\) be an arbitrary upper bound for \(cA\). This means that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
ca &amp;\leq b \\
a &amp;\leq b/c.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This means that \(b/c\) is an upper bound for \(A\). But \(A\) has a least upper bound \(\sup A\) and we know by condition two that any upper bound is greater than or equal to \(\sup A\) so</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
b/c &amp;\leq \sup A \\
b &amp;\leq c \sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Recall that \(b\) was arbitrary upper bound of \(cA\). Therefore, we can conclude from this that \(c \sup A\) is a least upper bound for \(cA\) as required. \(\blacksquare\)

This means that $$ \begin{align*} ca &amp;\leq b \\ a &amp;\leq b/c. \end{align*} $$ This means that \(b/c\) is an upper bound for \(A\). But \(A\) has a least upper bound \(\sup A\) and we know by condition two that any upper bound is greater than or equal to \(\sup A\) so $$ \begin{align*} b/c &amp;\leq \sup A \\ b &amp;\leq c \sup A. \end{align*} $$ Recall that \(b\) was arbitrary upper bound of \(cA\). Therefore, we can conclude from this that \(c \sup A\) is a least upper bound for \(cA\) as required. \(\blacksquare\) References: Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Least Upper Bound Epsilon Proof</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/05/05/analysis-least-upper-bound-epsilon.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Least Upper Bound Epsilon Proof" /><published>2024-05-05T01:01:36-07:00</published><updated>2024-05-05T01:01:36-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/05/05/analysis-least-upper-bound-epsilon</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/05/05/analysis-least-upper-bound-epsilon.html"><![CDATA[<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">

What is this statement saying? It’s important to review the definitions in <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">here</a>. Keep these on the side while working on this proof. For a set \(A\) with an upper bound \(s\), \(s\) can be qualified as the least upper bound if and only if “any number smaller than \(s\) is not an upper bound”. In other words, for \(s\) to be the least upper bound, then no matter how tiny \(\epsilon\) is, \(s - \epsilon\) will get disqualified from being an upper bound because we’re guaranteed to find an element in \(A\) that is greater than \(s - \epsilon\). So we can’t make \(s\) any smaller without losing its status of being an upper bound.
<br />

<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>We’ll prove both directions of the statement.</p>
<ul>
	<li>\((\Rightarrow)\) If \(s = \sup A\), then for every choice of \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) there exists an element \(a \in A\) such that \(s - \epsilon &lt; a\). </li>
We are given that \(s = \sup A\). We want to prove that \(s - \epsilon\) can't be an upper bound because if it was, then \(s\) is not the least upper bound.<br />
Consider \(s - \epsilon\) where \(\epsilon\) is chosen arbitrarily. We know by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">condition two</a> of the defintion of the least upper bound that if \(s = \sup A\), then for any upper bound \(b\) we must have 
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
s \leq b.

$$
</div>
This is saying that \(s\) must be less than or equal to any upper bound of \(A\) but we also know that 
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
s \geq s - \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
So \(s - \epsilon\) can not be an upper bound. Since it can not be an upper bound, then there must be an element \(a \in A\) such that \(a &gt; s - \epsilon\). This completes the proof in the right direction.
<br />
<br />

To prove that \(s = \sup A\), we need to verify the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">two conditions</a> of the least upper bound. We are given that \(s\) is an upper bound for \(A\) so condition one is satisfied. For condition two, let \(\epsilon\) be chosen arbitrarily. We are given that there will always be an element \(a \in A\) such that \(s - \epsilon &lt; a\). This means that for any \(epsilon\), \(s - \epsilon\) is not an upper bound.

  <b>Let \(A \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) be nonempty and bounded above. Let \(c \in \mathbf{R}\). Define the set \(A + c\) by \(c + A = \{ c + a: a \in A\}\). Then \(sup(c+A) = c + sup A\).</b>
</div>
<p><br />
What is this statement saying? It’s important to review the definitions in <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">here</a>. Keep these on the side while working on this proof. So assuming we have a least upper bound \(\sup A\). If the set was modified such that each element was changed by adding \(c\) to it, then the least upper bound will be \(c + \sup A\). Sounds very reasonable.
<br />
<br />
How do we prove it? Any time we want to prove something about least upper bounds we’ll need to verify both conditions of the definition of an upper bound. From the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">definitions page</a>, we need to verify that \(c + \sup A\) is indeed an upper bound and then prove that it’s the least one.
<br /></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \(A\) be a bounded non-empty set with a least upper bound \(s = \sup A\). Let \(c\) be a constant. Let \(c + A\) be the set \(\{c + a: a \in A\}\). Since \(s\) is an upper bound then we know that for every element \(a \in A\), we have \(a \leq s\). If we add \(c\) to both sides we’ll have \(a + c \leq s + c\). Therefore, we can see that \(c + s\) is also an upper bound for the set \(A + c\).
<br />
<br />
To verify condition two, let \(b\) be an arbitrarily chosen upper bound of the set \(A + c\). This means that \(a + c \leq b\) for every element \(a \in A\). We can re-write the inequality as,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a \leq b - c.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>From this we can conclude that \(b - c\) is an upper bound for \(A\). Earlier we defined \(s\) as the least upper bound for \(A\) so we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
s \leq b - c.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Re-writing this as,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
s + c \leq b
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>shows that \(s + c\) is less than or equal to any chosen upper bound of \(A + c\). This means that \(s + c\) must be the least upper bound of \(A + c\). This verifies condition two of the definition of the least upper bound. \(\blacksquare\)

<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Axiom of Completeness</b></h4>
<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">
  Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound.
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Upper and Lower Bounds</b></h4>
<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">
  A set \(A \in \mathbf{R}\) is bounded above if there exists a number \(b \in \mathbf{R}\) such that \(a \leq b\) for \(a \in A\). The number \(b\) is an upper bound for \(A\). Similarly, the set \(A\) is bounded below if there exists a lower bound \(l \in \mathbf{R}\) satisfying \(l \leq a\) for every \(a \in A\).
</div>
<p><br />
Note here that \(b\) doesn’t need to be \(A\). A set like \(\{1,2\}\) can have an upper bound like 3 for example. Every element in this set is less than 3. Also note here that \(A\) and \(b\) are both in \(\mathbf{R}\). 
<br /><br />
Questions: What if we don’t find such a \(b\)? can we conclude that the set is infinite?
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Least Upper and Greater Lower Bounds</b></h4>
<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">
  A real number \(s\) is the least upper bound for a set \(A \in \mathbf{R}\) if it meets the following two criteria:<br />(i) \(s\) is an upper bound for A; <br />(ii) if \(b\) is any upper bound for \(A\), then \(s \leq b\).
</div>
<p><br />
The least upper bound is also called the supremum of the set \(A\) or \(\sup A\) while the greatest lower bound is called the infimum or \(\inf A\). Both bounds are unique. There can only be least upper bound and one greatest lower bound. 
<br /><br />
Questions: since \(s\) must be an upper bound, does it mean that the set \(A\) is a bounded set?
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Minimum and Maximum</b></h4>
<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">
  A real number \(a_0\) is a maximum of the set \(A\) if \(a_0\) is an element of \(A\) and \(a_0 \geq a\) for all \(a \in A\). Similarly a real number \(a_1\) is a minimum \(a_1\) is a minimum of the set \(A\) if \(a_1 \in A\) and \(a_1 \leq a\) for all \(a \in A\).
</div>
<p><br />
It’s definitely clear here that the maximum and minimum must be elements of the set itself unlike the upper and lower bounds.

Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(a \neq b\). This means that the distance between \(a\) and \(b\) is greater than zero and so \(|a - b| &gt; 0\). Let this distance be \(d\) so we have \(d = |a - b|\).
