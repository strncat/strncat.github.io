  (Theorem 3.3.4) (Characterization of Compactness in R) A set \(K \in \mathbf{R}\) is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
</div>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>\(\Rightarrow\): Assume a set \(K\) is compact. We’ll prove that \(K\) is closed and bounded. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(K\) is not a bounded set. The definition of a compact set states that every sequence \((a_n)\) in \(K\) has a subsequence \(a_{n_k}\) that converges to a limit that is also in \(K\). So the idea is to derive a contradiction from finding some sequence that grows to infinity in a way that it cannot have a convergent subsequence. Since \(K\) is not a bounded set, then there must exists an element \(x_1 \in K\) such that \(|x_1| &gt; 1\). Similarly, there must exists some element \(x_2 \in K\) with \(x_2 &gt; 2\). In general, given any \(n \in \mathbf{N}\), we can produce \(x_n \in K\) such that \(|x_n| &gt; n\). \(x_1, x_2, ... x_n, ... = (x_n)\) is a sequence in \(K\). Since \(K\) is compact, then there must exist a convergent subsequence \((x_{n_k})\). But all the elements in \((x_{n_k})\) must satisfy \(|x_{n_k}| &gt; n_k\) (why? see <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/02/10/analysis-seq-subsequences.html">this</a>) and consequently \((x_{n_k})\) is unbounded. But <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/12/analysis-seq-if-convergent-then-bounded.html">theorem 2.3.2</a> states that convergent sequences must bounded. Therefore, we’ve arrived at a contradiction and \(K\) must be a bounded set.
<br />
<br />
To show that \(K\) is closed, we must show that it includes all of its limit points. Suppose \(x\) is a limit point of \(K\) such that \((x_n) \rightarrow x\) and \((x_n)\) is contained in \(K\). We will show that \(x \in K\). Since \(K\) is compact, then \((x_n)\) must have a convergent subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) with its limit is in \(K\). But by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/11/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence.html">theorem 2.5.2</a>, subsequences of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit and so \((x_n)\) must converge to the same limit in \(K\). Therefore \(K\) is closed as we wanted to show.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>\(\Leftarrow\): Assume \(K\) is closed and bounded. We will show that \(K\) is compact. Let \((x_n)\) be a sequence in \(K\). We will show that there exists a subsequence that converges to a limit also in \(K\). Since \(K\) is bounded, then there exists an \(M &gt; 0\) such that \(\lvert k\rvert \leq M\) for all \(k \in K\). This also implies that \(\lvert x \rvert \leq M\) for all \(x \in (x_n)\). This means that the sequence \((x_n)\) is bounded. By <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/14/analysis-seq-subseq-bolzano-weierstrass-theorem.html"> the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem</a>, then \((x_n)\) must contain a convergent subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) where \((x_{n_k}) \rightarrow l\). Moreover, we also know that \(K\) is closed. This means that \(K\) contains all of its limit points and therefore, \(l \in K\). From this we can conclude that \(K\) is compact as required. \(\blacksquare\)

  (Theorem 3.2.13) A set \(O\) is open if and only if \(O^c\) is closed. Likewise, a set \(F\) is closed if and only if \(F^c\) is open.
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>Let \(O \in \mathbf{R}\) be an open set. We need to prove that \(O^c\) is a closed set. To do so, we need to show that \(O^c\) contains all of its limit points. Let \(x\) be an arbitrary limit point of \(O^c\). Now suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(x \notin O^c\) so \(x \in O\). By the definition of an open set, this means that there exists some \(\delta\)-neighborhood, \(V_{\delta}(x)\), of \(x\) such that \(V_{\delta}(x) \subseteq O\). By the definition of a limit point, there exists a sequence \((a_n)\) such that \((a_n) \rightarrow x\) and \(a_n \in O^c\) and \(x\) is not a term of the sequence. This implies that for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), we must have an \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that when \(n &gt; N\), \(|a_n - x| \leq \epsilon\). But if we set \(\epsilon = \delta\), then \(a_n \in (x - \delta, x + \delta)\). This means that \((a_n)\) could not possibly converge since the terms in that interval are in \(O\) and not \(O^c\) because we earlier said that \(V_{\delta}(x) \subseteq O\). This is a contradiction and so \(x \in O\).
<br />
<br />
For the other direction. Suppose that \(O^c\) is closed. We need to prove that \(O\) is open. Then by the definition of an open set, given an element \(x \in O\), we need to produce an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood of \(x\) such that \(V_{\epsilon}(x) \subseteq O\). Since we assumed that \(O^c\) is closed, then \(O^c\) must contains all of its limits points and so \(x\) is not a limit point of \(O^c\). The definition of a limit point states that if \(x\) was a limit point, then every \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood of \(x\) intersects \(O^c\) at some point other than \(x\) but \(x\) is not a limit point of \(O^c\) and so there exists some \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\) that doesn’t intersect \(O^c\) and therefore \(V_{\epsilon}(x) \in O\).
<br />
<br />
For the second statement, it follows from the fact that \((O^c)^c = O\). \(\blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>Let \([c,d] = \{c \leq x \leq d\}\) be a closed interval.

  Prove that a set \(F \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) is closed if and only if it contains its limit points.
</div>
<p><br />
This was listed in the book as a definition but I was wondering why it’s true. I did find the following proof <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh1noyFVNVg">online</a> that relies on the fact that a set \(O\) is open if and only if \(O^c\) is closed. But in the book we proved the previous statement using the definition that closed sets contain their limit points. So it’s circular and we just have to assume one to get the other. 
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>\(\Rightarrow\): Let \(F\) be a set and assume that \(F\) is closed, then we’ll prove that \(F\) contains its limit points. To do so, assume for the sake of contradiction that it doesn’t. Therefore, let \(x\) be a limit point such that \(x \notin F\). By the definition of a <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/24/analysis-sets-limit-points.html">limit point</a>, we know there must exist a sequence \((a_n)\) that is contained in \(F\) such that \((a_n) \rightarrow x\) and \(x\) is not a term of the sequence. Since \(x\) is not in \(F\), then \(x\) must be in \(F^c\) and since \(F\) is closed, \(F^c\) must be open (todo proof link). But by the definition of an <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/22/analysis-sets-open.html">open set</a> there must exist an interval around \(x\) that is all included in \(F^c\) or in other words, for some \(\delta &gt; 0\), we must have some interval \((x-\delta, x+\delta) \subseteq F^c\). But this means that the sequence \((a_n)\) can’t possibly converge to \(x\) since the neighborhood \((x-\delta, x+\delta)\) is not in \(F\). Rigorously, since \((a_n) \rightarrow x\), then for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), we must have an \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that if \(n \geq N\), \(|a_n - x| &lt; \epsilon\). This means that after the \(N\)th term, \(n\) can get really close to \(x\). But if set \(\epsilon = \delta\), this means that \(a_n \in (x - \delta, x + \delta)\). This means that these terms are part of \(F^c\) and not \(F\). This is a contradiction and so \(x\) must belong to \(F\) as we wanted to show.
<br />
<br />
\(\Leftarrow\): We will prove the contrapositive of the statement instead so assume that \(F\) is not closed, we will prove that \(F\) doesn’t contain all of its limit points. Since \(F\) is not closed, then \(F^c\) is not open (TODO: add proof link). By the definition of an <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/22/analysis-sets-open.html">open set</a>, we know that for any point \(f\) in the set, there exist an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood such that \(V_{\epsilon}(f)\) is included in the set. But because \(F^c\) is not open, then there exists an element \(x \in F^c\) such that for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\) is not a subset of \(F^c\). This means that there will always be some element in \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\) that is not contained in \(F^c\) and so it is in \(F\). Now, for each \(n \in \mathbf{N}\), take \(a_n \in V_{1/n}(x) \cap F\). So \(a_1 \in V_1(x)\), \(a_2 \in V_{1/2},...\). This sequence will converge to \(x\) because as we move further, \(a_n\) gets closer and closer to \(x\). To prove that \((a_n) \rightarrow x\), suppose \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) and choose \(N &gt; 1/\epsilon\) so that for any \(n &gt; N\),</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|a_n - x| &amp;&lt; \frac{1}{n} \\
&amp;&lt; \frac{1}{N} \\
&amp;&lt; \frac{1}{1/\epsilon} = \epsilon,
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>which shows that \((a_n) \rightarrow x\). So we just showed a sequence in \(F\) where its limit point \(x\) is not in \(F\) as required. \(\blacksquare\).

In this note, we’ll study Closed Sets. (Definition 3.2.6) A point \(a \in A\) is an isolated point of \(A\) if it is not a limit point of \(A\). An isolated point always belongs to the set \(A\) unlike a limit point where it’s not necessirely an element of the set!

  (3.2.5) A point \(x\) is a limit point of a set \(A\) if and only if \(x = \lim a_n\) for some sequence \(a_n\) contained in \(A\) satisfying \(a_n \neq x\) for all \(n \in \mathbf{N}\).

So “\(x\) is a limit point of \(A\)” means that \(x\) is the limit of a sequence in \(A\). The only thing we don’t want is to have any term of that sequence be \(x\) itself. The reason for this is then every member of the set could potentially be a limit point since we can create the sequence \(\{x,x,x,x,x,...\}\) and we don’t want that.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>\(\Rightarrow\): Assume that \(x\) is a limit point of \(A\) and so for every \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), the intersection of \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\) with the set \(A\) is nonempty and has an element that is not \(x\). We then want to prove that there is a sequence of points \(a_1, a_2, a_3, ...\) from \(A/\{x\}\) such that \((a_n) \rightarrow x\). Now for each \(n \in \mathbf{N}\), pick a point</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a_n \in V_{1/n}(x) \cap A,
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This means that the first element in the sequence is in \(V_1(x)\), the second element is in \(V_{1/2}(x)\). The third element is in \(V_{1/3}(x)\) and so on (We are basically getting closer and closer to \(x\)). This sequence \((a_n)\) coverages to \(x\). To see why, let \(\epsilon &gt; 0\). We can choose \(N\) such that \(N &gt; \frac{1}{\epsilon}\). So now for any \(n &gt; N\),</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|a_n - x| &amp;&lt; \frac{1}{n} \quad \text{ All the elements in $V_{1/n}$ must be within $1/n$ at most from $x$}\\
&amp;&lt; \frac{1}{N} \\
&amp;&lt; \frac{1}{1/\epsilon} = \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>

<p><br />
<br />
\(\Leftarrow\): Assume that \((a_n) \rightarrow x\) where \(a_n \in A\) and \(a_n \neq x\). Let \(V_{\epsilon}\) be arbitrary. We want to prove that there some element from \((a_n)\) in that neighborhood \(V_{\epsilon}\). But since \((a_n) \rightarrow x\), then we know that there exists an \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that if \(n \geq N\), we must have \(|a_n - x| \leq \epsilon\). Therefore, for any \(n \geq N\), we know that we have \(a_n \in V_{\epsilon}\).</p>

<p>\(\blacksquare\).
