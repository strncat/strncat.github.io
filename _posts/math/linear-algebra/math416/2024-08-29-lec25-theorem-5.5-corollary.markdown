Theorem 5.5 Corollary
</div>
<div class="purbdiv">
Let \(T\) be a linear operator on an \(n\)-dimensional vector space \(V\). If \(T\) has \(n\) distinct eigenvalues, then \(T\) is diagonalizable.
</div>
<br>
<b>Proof:</b>
<br>
<br>
Suppose that $$T$$ has distinct eigenvalues $$\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n$$. For each $$i$$, choose an eigenvector $$v_i$$ corresponding to $$\lambda_i$$. By theorem 5.5, we know that $$\{v_1,...,v_n\}$$ must be linearly independent and since $$\dim(V)=n$$, then this set must be a basis for $$V$$. Since we have a basis of eigenvectors then by theorem 5.1, $$T$$ must be diagonalizable. $$\ blacksquare$$
