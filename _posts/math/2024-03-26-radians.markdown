From wikipedia, "One radian is defined as the angle subtended from the center of a circle which intercepts an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle". Some additional facts:
<ul>
<li> The ratio of the circumference ($c$) to the diameter ($d$) of the circle (any circle) is the constant $\pi$. </li>
	<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\pi = \frac{c}{d} = \frac{c}{2r}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
    </div>

<li> This means that the circumference is given by, </li>
	\begin{align}
	c = 2\pi r.
	\end{align}

<li> Since the circumference is $2\pi r$, then there are $2\pi r / r = 2\pi$ such arcs of length $r$ in any circle each. This is about 6.28 arcs! (see below)</li>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/math/trig/arcs.png" width="55%" class="center"></p>
	


<li> So, we have $2\pi$ arcs of length $r$ that cover the whole circle. Each of their angles is measured at 1 radian. This means that to go a whole rotation around the entire circle we need $2\pi * 1 = 2\pi$ radians. </li>

<li> So, a 360 degrees measure is equal to $2\pi$ radians or in other words, 1 radian is equal to 57.2958 degrees and that's where the conversion formula between degrees and radians come from. </li>
</ul>
