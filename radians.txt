I've always wondered about where the term radian came from. Radian is known to be the standard unit of the angular measure. Here is some stuff I found while learning about this:

1) The ratio of the circumference ($c$) to the diameter ($d$) of the circle (any circle) is the constant $\pi$. 
\begin{align*}
\pi = \frac{c}{d} = frac{c}{2r}.
\end{align*}

2) This means that the circumference is given by,
\begin{align}
c = 2\pi r$.
\end{align}
A unit circle therefore will have its circumference be $2\pi$.


3) One radian is the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc that is equal to the radius of the circle.

4) Since the circumference is $2\pi r$ and the measure of the angle in radians is defined to be 1 for an arc of length $r$, we can learn two things. First, there are $2\pi r / r = 2\pi$ such arcs of length $r$ each (see below). Second, each of these arcs has an angle measured to be exactly 1 radian.
\figure (6.28 such arcs)


5) So, we have $2\pi$ arcs of length $r$ that cover the whole circle. Each of these angles is measured at 1 radian. This means that to go a whole rotation around the entire circle we need $2\pi$ radians.


6) So, a 360 degrees measure is equal to $2\pi$ radians or in other words, 1 radian is equal to 57.2958 degrees and that's where the conversion formula between degrees and radians come from.
