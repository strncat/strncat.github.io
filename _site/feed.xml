Theorem

<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be \(p\)-group which acts on a finite set \(X\). Then \(|X^G| \equiv |X| (\bmod p)\)
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br /></p>
<p>Proof</p>
<p>The idea is that since \(G\) acts on \(X\), then it partitions \(X\) into non-empty disjoint orbits. So we can write \(O_1,O_2,...O_r\) for the orbits of the action. Then</p>

$$
\begin{align*}
|X| = |O_1| + |O_2| + ... + |O_r|

<p>But we know that \(|G|=p^k\) and we also know that any orbit size must divide the group order. Therefore, \(|O_i| \in \{1,p,p^2,...p^k\}\). Break the orbits into two types. Let</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
O_1, O_2, ..., O_d

$$
</div>
<p>be orbits of size 1 and let</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
O_{d+1}, O_{d+2}, ..., O_r
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>be orbits of size \(r\). So now</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|X| = (|O_1| + |O_2| + ... + |O_d|) + (|O_{d+1}| + |O_{d+2}| + ... + |O_{r}|)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>where \(|O_1| + |O_2| + ... + |O_d|=d\) and \(|O_{d+1}| + |O_{d+2}| + ... + |O_{r}|\) is divisible by \(p\) so it’s some multiple \(k\) of \(p\). More precisely, \(d\) is the number of elements that are in orbits of size 1. By definition, this is the fixed set of the action so \(|X^G| = d\). Therefore</p>

<h4><b>Application of the Fixed Point Theorem</b></h4>
<p>Here are some application of this theorem

<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be \(p\)-group. Then the center of the group \(Z(G) = \{ g \in G \ | \ gh = hg \text{ for all } h \in H\}\) is non-trivial so \(Z(G) \neq \{e\}\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br /></p>
<p>Proof</p>
<p>Let \(G\) acts on \(X = G\) itself by conjugation. So we have \(c: G \rightarrow Sym(X)\). The fixed points of this action are</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
X^G &amp;= \{x \in X \ | \ gx = x \text{ for all } g \in G\} \\
 &amp;= \{x \in X \ | \ c(g)(x) = x \text{ for all } g \in G\} \quad \text{(the action is the conjugation action)} \\
&amp;= \{x \in X \ | gxg^{-1} = x \text{ for all } g \in G\} \\
&amp;= \{x \in X \ | gx = xg \text{ for all } g \in G\} 
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So in the conjugation action, the fixed point set is the center of the set. By the previous theorem we know that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|X^G| &amp;\equiv |X| (\bmod p) \\
|X^G| &amp;\equiv p^k (\bmod p) \quad \text{(order of $|G|$ is $p^k$)} \\
|X^G| &amp;\equiv 0 (\bmod p)  \quad \text{because ($p^k \equiv 0 (\bmod p)$)}\\
|Z(G)| &amp;\equiv 0 (\bmod p)  \quad \text{(we just showed this)}\\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Therefore, \(Z(G) - 0 = pm\) for some \(m \in Z\). This means that \(p \ | \ Z(G)\). But \(Z(G)\) is a subgroup so it includes at least the identity element. So its size is at least 1. Therefore, \(|Z(G)| \geq p \geq 2\). So we must have at least one non-trivial element in the center. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
So again, \(p-\)groups will always have a non-trivial center. Next, we have a corollary of this
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(p\) be a prime number. Then every group of order \(p^2\) is abelian.
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Using this, we can now use the elementary divisor theorem to classify these groups. In fact, \(G\) of order (p^2) is isomorphic to either \(\mathbf{Z}_{p^2}\) or \(\mathbf{Z}_p \times \mathbf{Z}_p\). 
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof</b>
Let \(|G| = p^2\). By the proposition, \(Z(G)\) is not trivial. But we also know that it is a subgroup. So its order must divide the order of the group. So its order must either be \(p\) or \(p^2\). If the order is \(p^2\), then every element commute with every other element so \(G\) must be abelian. So we only have case which is when \(|Z(G)| = p\). Now, recall that \(Z(G)\) is a normal subgroup in \(G\). Therefore, we can form the quotient group \(G/Z(G)\). The order of this quotient group is \(p^2/p = p\). But we also know that every group of prime order is cyclic so \(G/Z(G)\) is cyclic. By Homework ?, if we have a group \(G\) where its quotient group mod its center is cyclic (\(G/Z(G)\)), then \(G\) is abelian. So \(G\) is abelian in this case too. \(\ \blacksquare\).

Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a finite group. If \(p\) is a prime number that divides \(|G|\), then \(G\) must have element of order \(p\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
A special case of this is the even-order theorem. As a reminder, let’s revisit this proof in terms of group actions before proving the actual theorem. 
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof (Even Order Theorem)</b>
<br />
Let \(|G| = n\) where \(n\) is even. Let \(C = \langle \varphi \rangle = \{e, \varphi\}\) be a cyclic group of order 2. Let \(C\) act on the set \(X = C\) which is the group itself. We know the identity elements acts as the identity function on \(X\). So we only have to define the action for \(\varphi\). So let’s define what \(\varphi(g)\) is for every element of the group. Let \(\varphi(g)\) be</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi(g) = g^{-1} \quad \text{for } g \in G
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This is in fact is a bijection. Note here, \(\varphi \circ \varphi = id\) so composing the action \(\varphi\) with itself gives us back the identity function. Now, \(C\) is a 2-group since its of order 2. So we can apply the fixed point theorem which states that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|X^C| &amp;\equiv |X| (\bmod 2) \\
|X^C| &amp;\equiv 2 (\bmod 2) \quad \text{(We know $|X| = 2$)}\\
|X^C| &amp;\equiv 0 (\bmod 2)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So \(|X^C|\) must be even. \(X^C\) is the set of elements that are fixed by the action \(\varphi\) so</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
X^C &amp;= \{x \in X \ | \ \varphi(x) = x\} \\
    &amp;= \{x \in X \ | \ x^{-1} = x\} \\
	&amp;= \{x \in X \ | \ x^2 = e\}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So this group has an even number of elements and must at least include the identity element. Therefore, it must have at least one more non-trivial element of order 2. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof (Cauchy’s Theorem)</b>
<br />
Let \(G\) be a group of order \(n\). Suppose \(p\) is a prime number such that \(p \ | \ n\). Let \(C = \langle \varphi \rangle\) be a cyclic group of order \(p\). Let \(X\) be the set</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
X = \{(a_1,...,a_p) \in G^p \ | \ a_1,...a_p \in G, a_1a_2...a_p = e\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So it’s the set of all \(p\) tuples such that when we multiply any tuple’s elements, we get the identity. But we can re-write this as</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a_p =  (a_1,a_2...a_{p-1})^{-1}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So the last element \(a_p\) is the inverse of the previous elements all multiplied. So for any \(g\) to be in \(G^p\), we can pick \(p-1\) elements from \(G\) and then form the last element by taking their product and taking the inverse of that product. 
<br />
<br />
What is \(|X|\)? we have \(n\) choices for the first \(p-1\) elements but only 1 choice for the last element. This implies that \(|X| = n^{p-1}\). Moreover, by assumption we know that \(p\) divides \(|G|=n\). So \(n = pk\) for some \(k\). So we can write \(|X| = (pk)^{p-1}\). But \(p\) is prime so it’s at least 2. Therefore, \(p\) must divide \(|X|\) as well.
<br />
<br />
Now, let \(C\) act on \(X\). Define</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi \cdot (a_1,a_2,...,a_{p-1},a_p) = (a_p,a_1,...,a_{p-1})
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So the action permutes the elements cyclicly. We need to verify that the product is in \(X\). This means if we multiply the first \(p-1\) elements and take their inverse, we should get the last element. To show this notice that \((a_1,a_2,...,a_{p-1},a_p)\) is in \(X\) by assumption so we know that the product of the elements is \(e\). Now conjugate this product by \(a^{p}\) to see that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
(a_1a_2...a_{p-1}a_p) &amp;= e \\
a_p(a_1a_2...a_{p-1}a_p)a_p^{-1} &amp;= a_pea_p^{-1} \\
a_pa_1a_2...a_{p-1} &amp;= e.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So we can see that \(a_pa_1a_2...a_{p-1} \in X\) which is what we wanted to show. Additionally, if we apply \(\varphi\) \(p\) times, we will see that \(\varphi \circ \varphi \circ ... \varphi = id\) it will take us to the identity function or action. So this action or permutation has order \(p\). 
<br />
<br />
So now we have \(|G| = n\) and \(|X| = n^{p-1}\). We know \(p\) divides both. We can apply the fixed point theorem but what is \(X^C\)? By definition, it’s the set of elements fixed by any \(g \in \langle \varphi \rangle\). But since \(\langle \varphi \rangle\) is cyclic, then if an element gets fixed by \(\varphi\), it get fixed by any power of \(\varphi\). Therefore</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
X^C &amp;= \{x \in X \ | \ \varphi(x) = x\} \\
    &amp;= \{(a_1,...,a_p) \in G \ | \ a_1...a_p = e \text{ and } \varphi \cdot (a_1,...,a_p) = (a_1,...,a_p)\} \\
    &amp;= \{(a_1,...,a_p) \in G \ | \ a_1...a_p = e \text{ and }  (a_p,a_1...,a_{p-1}) = (a_1,a_2...,a_p)\}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This last condition says that \(a_p=a_1\), \(a_1=a_2\), … \(a_{p-1}=a_p\). This means that all the elements are the same. So we can write \(X^C\) as</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
X^C &amp;= \{ (a,a...,a) \ | \ a \in G, aa...a = a^p = e\}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Therefore, the size of this set, is the number of elements in \(G\) which have order \(p\). So</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|X^C| &amp;= |\{ a \in G \ | \ a^p = e\}|.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We know \(e \in X^C\) since e\(e^p = e\). Moreover, by the Fixed Point Theorem,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|X^C| &amp;\equiv |X| (\bmod p) \\
|X^C| &amp;\equiv 0 (\bmod p) \quad \text{(because $p \ | \ |X|$)}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So \(|X^C|\) must be divisible by \(p\) and since \(|X^C| \geq 1\), then \(|X^C| \geq p\). But this means that \(G\) has at least one non-trivial element of order \(p\). \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />

<h4><b>Classification of Groups of Order 6</b></h4>
<p>We’ve seen before \(\mathbf{Z}_6 \cong \mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_3\) and we’ve also seen \(D_3 \cong S_3\). 
<br />
<br />
Suppose \(|G| = 6 = 2(3)\). These are prime factors, so we can use Cauchy’s Theorem twice to conclude that we must have an element of order 2 and another element of order 3. So let</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
A &amp;= \langle a \rangle \text{ where $|A| = 2$ } \\
N &amp;= \langle 3 \rangle \text{ where $|N| = 3$}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This implies that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
[G:N] = \frac{|G|}{|N|} = \frac{6}{3} = 2.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>But we’ve seen in one of the homeworks, that this implies that \(N\) is normal. We also know the following facts</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(N \cap A = \{e\}\) since elements of \(N\) have order 1 or 3 and elements of \(A\) have orders 1 and 2</li>
	<li>\(NA\) is a subgroup of \(G\) because one of the groups is normal by Corollary (26.4).</li>
	<li>By the Diamond Isomorphism Theorem, \(A/A \cap N \cong NA/N\). But since \(A \cap N = \{e\}\). Then \(A \cong NA/N\). This means that \(|NA|/|N| = |A|\). So \(|NA| = |A||N| = 6\)</li>
	<li>Since \(NA\) is a subgroup of size 6, then it's \(G\) so \(NA = G\)</li>
</ul>
<p>So we know 4 important things</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(A\) is a subgroup of \(G\).</li>
	<li>\(N\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\).</li>
	<li>\(G = NA\).</li>
	<li>\(A \cap N = \{e\}\).</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the 4 conditions so we can apply the the recognization theorem to conclude that there exists a homomorphism \(\gamma: A \rightarrow \text{Aut}(N)\) such that there is an isomorphism of groups</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
N \rtimes_{\gamma} A \cong G
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>\(A\) is of order 2 so it must be isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). \(N\) is of order 3 so it’s isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_3\). We know that \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_3) \cong \Phi(3)\) But \(\Phi(3)\) is of order 2 so it’s isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). So how many homomorphisms can we have from \(A\) to \(\text{Aut}(N)\) if both groups are cyclic of order 2? There are only two choices.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The trivial homomorphism gives us the product group \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_3\)</li>
	<li>The non-trivial homomorphism gives us the dihedral group \(D_3\).</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Study Notes on \(D_3\)</b></h4>
<p>How does the non-trivial homomorphism gives us the dihedral group? how does this happen? We have</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(N = \langle n \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_3\) where \(n^3 = e\).</li>
	<li>\(A = \langle a \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\) where \(a^2 = e\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Define</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_3) \\
	\gamma(a) &amp;= \alpha \text{ where } \alpha(n) = n^{-1} \\
	\gamma(a)(n) &amp;= n^{-1}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So the element \(a \in A\) acts on \(n \in N\) by inverting it. Observe that \(a^2 = e\) and \(\alpha^2 = (n^{-1})^{-1} = \text{id}\) so \(\gamma(\alpha^2) = \gamma(\alpha)^2\). So now multiplication in semi-direct groups is defined as</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(n^i, a^j)(n^k, a^l) = (n^i \cdot \gamma_{a^j}(n^k), a^{j}a^{j})
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(a\) has order 2 so \(\gamma_{a^j}(n^k)\) is defined as</p>
<ul>
	<li>When \(j = 0\), then \(a^0 = 0\), then \(\gamma_{e} = id\).</li>
	<li>When \(j = 1\), then \(a^1 = a\), then \(\gamma_{a} = \alpha\) where \(\alpha(n) = n^{-k}\).</li>
</ul>
<p>So now if we apply the semidirect product multiplication, using the homomorphism we defined, we will see that for any \(a\), that we get the relationship \(ana^{-1} = n^{-1}\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Classification of Groups of Order \(2p\)</b></h4>
<p>where \(p\) is an odd prime. We know two groups \(\mathbf{Z}_{2p} =\mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{p}\) and \(D_p\). 
<br />
<br />
Let \(|G| = 2p\). By Cauchy, \(2\) divides \(|G|\). Therefore, we have an element of order \(2\). From this, we get \(A = \langle a \rangle\) where \(|A| = 2\). We also have an element of order \(p\). From this we get \(N = \langle N \rangle\). Again, we will see that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
[G:N] = \frac{|G|}{|N|} = \frac{2p}{p} = 2.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Therefore \(N\) is normal. With a similar argument to the previous example. We will see that</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(A\) is a subgroup of \(G\).</li>
	<li>\(N\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\).</li>
	<li>\(G = NA\).</li>
	<li>\(A \cap N = \{e\}\).</li>
</ul>
<p>So we can use the recognization theorem again to conclude that there exists a homomorphism \(\gamma: A \rightarrow \text{Aut}(N)\) such that there is an isomorphism of groups</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
N \rtimes_{\gamma} A \cong G
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>\(A\) is of order 2 so it must be isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). \(N\) is of order \(p\) so it’s isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_p\) (cyclic). We know that \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_p) \cong \Phi(p)\) where \(\Phi(p)\) is of order \(p-1\). So how many homomorphisms can we have from \(A\) to \(\text{Aut}(N)\).</p>
<ul>
	<li>The trivial homomorphism gives us the product group \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_p\)</li>
	<li>The non-trivial homomorphism gives us the dihedral group \(D_p\).</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Classification of Groups of Order \(pq\)</b></h4>
<p>\(p\) and \(q\) are distinct primes where \(p &gt; q\). So again we have \(|G|=pq\). By Cauchy, we have two cyclic subgroups such that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
A &amp;= \langle a \rangle \text{ where $|A| = q$ } \\
N &amp;= \langle b \rangle \text{ where $|N| = p$}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This implies that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
[G:N] = \frac{|G|}{|N|} = q.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>\(q\) is the smallest prime dividing the order of \(|G|\). By some homework assignment that said that if we have a subgroup of order “the smallest prime dividing the order”, then this subgroup is normal. So now again,</p>
<ul>

Define Definition Define \(X^G = \{x \in X \ | \ gx = x \text{ for all } g \in G\} \subseteq X \). This set is called the Fixed Point set of the action. Compare this to the definition for any \(g \in G\), then. $$ \begin{align*} \text{Fix}(g) = \{x \in X \ | \ gx = x\} \end{align*} $$ So this is the set of elements fixed by \(g\) but what we defined above is the set of elements in \(X\) such that they’re always fixed by any \(g\). This means that we can re-write the definition to $$ \begin{align*} X^G = \bigcap_{g \in G}\text{Fix}(g) \end{align*} $$ We can also describe this set another way. Recall that an element \(x\) is fixed by every element \(g \in G\) if and only if its orbit contains only the element \(x\) itself. So now we can re-write the definition to be $$ \begin{align*} X^G = \{x \in X \ | \ O(x) = \{x\} \} \end{align*} $$ Recall now that \(\text{Stab}(x) = \{g \in G \ | \ gx = x\}\). So we can re-write this definition to say $$ \begin{align*} X^G = \{x \in X \ | \ \text{Stab}(x) = G \} \end{align*} $$ Fixed Point Theorem We’ll study one theorem about this. But first define Definition Let \(p\) be a prime number. A \(p\)-group is a group of order \(p^k\) for some \(k \geq 1\). For example \(\mathbf{Z}_{p^k}\) is a \(p\)-group. The cyclic group like \(\mathbf{Z}_{p^i} \times \mathbf{Z}_{p^j}\) is another \(p\)-group. Or the dihedral group \(D_{2^k}\) which has order \(2^{k+1}\) so this is a 2-group. Theorem Let \(G\) be \(p\)-group which acts on a finite set \(X\). Then \(|X^G| \equiv |X| (\bmod p)\) Proof The idea is that since \(G\) acts on \(X\), then it partitions \(X\) into non-empty disjoint orbits. So we can write \(O_1,O_2,...O_r\) for the orbits of the action. Then $$ \begin{align*} |X| = |O_1| + |O_2| + ... + |O_r| \end{align*} $$ But we know that \(|G|=p^k\) and we also know that any orbit size must divide the group order. Therefore, \(|O_i| \in \{1,p,p^2,...p^k\}\). Break the orbits into two types. Let $$ \begin{align*} O_1, O_2, ..., O_d \end{align*} $$ be orbits of size 1 and let $$ \begin{align*} O_{d+1}, O_{d+2}, ..., O_r \end{align*} $$ be orbits of size \(r\). So now $$ \begin{align*} |X| = (|O_1| + |O_2| + ... + |O_d|) + (|O_{d+1}| + |O_{d+2}| + ... + |O_{r}|) \end{align*} $$ where \(|O_1| + |O_2| + ... + |O_d|=d\) and \(|O_{d+1}| + |O_{d+2}| + ... + |O_{r}|\) is divisible by \(p\) so it’s some multiple \(k\) of \(p\). More precisely, \(d\) is the number of elements that are in orbits of size 1. By definition, this is the fixed set of the action so \(|X^G| = d\). Therefore $$ \begin{align*} |X| &amp;= d + kp \\ |X| - d &amp;= kp \\ \end{align*} $$ Therefore, $$ \begin{align*} |X| &amp;\equiv d (\bmod p) \\ |X| &amp;\equiv |X^G| (\bmod p) \end{align*} $$ Application of the Fixed Point Theorem Here are some application of this theorem Proposition Let \(G\) be \(p\)-group. Then the center of the group \(Z(G) = \{ g \in G \ | \ gh = hg \text{ for all } h \in H\}\) is non-trivial so \(Z(G) \neq \{e\}\). Proof Let \(G\) acts on \(X = G\) itself by conjugation. So we have \(c: G \rightarrow Sym(X)\). The fixed points of this action are $$ \begin{align*} X^G &amp;= \{x \in X \ | \ gx = x \text{ for all } g \in G\} \\ &amp;= \{x \in X \ | \ c(g)(x) = x \text{ for all } g \in G\} \quad \text{(the action is the conjugation action)} \\ &amp;= \{x \in X \ | gxg^{-1} = x \text{ for all } g \in G\} \\ &amp;= \{x \in X \ | gx = xg \text{ for all } g \in G\} \end{align*} $$ So in the conjugation action, the fixed point set is the center of the set. By the previous theorem we know that $$ \begin{align*} |X^G| &amp;\equiv |X| (\bmod p) \\ |X^G| &amp;\equiv p^k (\bmod p) \quad \text{(order of $|G|$ is $p^k$)} \\ |X^G| &amp;\equiv 0 (\bmod p) \quad \text{because ($p^k \equiv 0 (\bmod p)$)}\\ |Z(G)| &amp;\equiv 0 (\bmod p) \quad \text{(we just showed this)}\\ \end{align*} $$ Therefore, \(Z(G) - 0 = pm\) for some \(m \in Z\). This means that \(p \ | \ Z(G)\). But \(Z(G)\) is a subgroup so it includes at least the identity element. So its size is at least 1. Therefore, \(|Z(G)| \geq p \geq 2\). So we must have at least one non-trivial element in the center. \(\ \blacksquare\) So again, \(p-\)groups will always have a non-trivial center. Next, we have a corollary of this Proposition Let \(p\) be a prime number. Then every group of order \(p^2\) is abelian. Using this, we can now use the elementary divisor theorem to classify these groups. In fact, \(G\) of order (p^2) is isomorphic to either \(\mathbf{Z}_{p^2}\) or \(\mathbf{Z}_p \times \mathbf{Z}_p\). Proof Let \(|G| = p^2\). By the proposition, \(Z(G)\) is not trivial. But we also know that it is a subgroup. So its order must divide the order of the group. So its order must either be \(p\) or \(p^2\). If the order is \(p^2\), then every element commute with every other element so \(G\) must be abelian. So we only have case which is when \(|Z(G)| = p\). Now, recall that \(Z(G)\) is a normal subgroup in \(G\). Therefore, we can form the quotient group \(G/Z(G)\). The order of this quotient group is \(p^2/p = p\). But we also know that every group of prime order is cyclic so \(G/Z(G)\) is cyclic. By Homework ?, if we have a group \(G\) where its quotient group mod its center is cyclic (\(G/Z(G)\)), then \(G\) is abelian. So \(G\) is abelian in this case too. \(\ \blacksquare\). Cauchy Theorem There is one more application of the fixed point theorem. Theorem Let \(G\) be a finite group. If \(p\) is a prime number that divides \(|G|\), then \(G\) must have element of order \(p\). A special case of this is the even-order theorem. As a reminder, let’s revisit this proof in terms of group actions before proving the actual theorem. Proof (Even Order Theorem) Let \(|G| = n\) where \(n\) is even. Let \(C = \langle \varphi \rangle = \{e, \varphi\}\) be a cyclic group of order 2. Let \(C\) act on the set \(X = C\) which is the group itself. We know the identity elements acts as the identity function on \(X\). So we only have to define the action for \(\varphi\). So let’s define what \(\varphi(g)\) is for every element of the group. Let \(\varphi(g)\) be $$ \begin{align*} \varphi(g) = g^{-1} \quad \text{for } g \in G \end{align*} $$ This is in fact is a bijection. Note here, \(\varphi \circ \varphi = id\) so composing the action \(\varphi\) with itself gives us back the identity function. Now, \(C\) is a 2-group since its of order 2. So we can apply the fixed point theorem which states that $$ \begin{align*} |X^C| &amp;\equiv |X| (\bmod 2) \\ |X^C| &amp;\equiv 2 (\bmod 2) \quad \text{(We know $|X| = 2$)}\\ |X^C| &amp;\equiv 0 (\bmod 2) \end{align*} $$ So \(|X^C|\) must be even. \(X^C\) is the set of elements that are fixed by the action \(\varphi\) so $$ \begin{align*} X^C &amp;= \{x \in X \ | \ \varphi(x) = x\} \\ &amp;= \{x \in X \ | \ x^{-1} = x\} \\ &amp;= \{x \in X \ | \ x^2 = e\}. \end{align*} $$ So this group has an even number of elements and must at least include the identity element. Therefore, it must have at least one more non-trivial element of order 2. \(\ \blacksquare\) Proof (Cauchy’s Theorem) Let \(G\) be a group of order \(n\). Suppose \(p\) is a prime number such that \(p \ | \ n\). Let \(C = \langle \varphi \rangle\) be a cyclic group of order \(p\). Let \(X\) be the set $$ \begin{align*} X = \{(a_1,...,a_p) \in G^p \ | \ a_1,...a_p \in G, a_1a_2...a_p = e\} \end{align*} $$ So it’s the set of all \(p\) tuples such that when we multiply any tuple’s elements, we get the identity. But we can re-write this as $$ \begin{align*} a_p = (a_1,a_2...a_{p-1})^{-1} \end{align*} $$ So the last element \(a_p\) is the inverse of the previous elements all multiplied. So for any \(g\) to be in \(G^p\), we can pick \(p-1\) elements from \(G\) and then form the last element by taking their product and taking the inverse of that product. What is \(|X|\)? we have \(n\) choices for the first \(p-1\) elements but only 1 choice for the last element. This implies that \(|X| = n^{p-1}\). Moreover, by assumption we know that \(p\) divides \(|G|=n\). So \(n = pk\) for some \(k\). So we can write \(|X| = (pk)^{p-1}\). But \(p\) is prime so it’s at least 2. Therefore, \(p\) must divide \(|X|\) as well. Now, let \(C\) act on \(X\). Define $$ \begin{align*} \varphi \cdot (a_1,a_2,...,a_{p-1},a_p) = (a_p,a_1,...,a_{p-1}) \end{align*} $$ So the action permutes the elements cyclicly. We need to verify that the product is in \(X\). This means if we multiply the first \(p-1\) elements and take their inverse, we should get the last element. To show this notice that \((a_1,a_2,...,a_{p-1},a_p)\) is in \(X\) by assumption so we know that the product of the elements is \(e\). Now conjugate this product by \(a^{p}\) to see that $$ \begin{align*} (a_1a_2...a_{p-1}a_p) &amp;= e \\ a_p(a_1a_2...a_{p-1}a_p)a_p^{-1} &amp;= a_pea_p^{-1} \\ a_pa_1a_2...a_{p-1} &amp;= e. \end{align*} $$ So we can see that \(a_pa_1a_2...a_{p-1} \in X\) which is what we wanted to show. Additionally, if we apply \(\varphi\) \(p\) times, we will see that \(\varphi \circ \varphi \circ ... \varphi = id\) it will take us to the identity function or action. So this action or permutation has order \(p\). So now we have \(|G| = n\) and \(|X| = n^{p-1}\). We know \(p\) divides both. We can apply the fixed point theorem but what is \(X^C\)? By definition, it’s the set of elements fixed by any \(g \in \langle \varphi \rangle\). But since \(\langle \varphi \rangle\) is cyclic, then if an element gets fixed by \(\varphi\), it get fixed by any power of \(\varphi\). Therefore $$ \begin{align*} X^C &amp;= \{x \in X \ | \ \varphi(x) = x\} \\ &amp;= \{(a_1,...,a_p) \in G \ | \ a_1...a_p = e \text{ and } \varphi \cdot (a_1,...,a_p) = (a_1,...,a_p)\} \\ &amp;= \{(a_1,...,a_p) \in G \ | \ a_1...a_p = e \text{ and } (a_p,a_1...,a_{p-1}) = (a_1,a_2...,a_p)\}. \end{align*} $$ This last condition says that \(a_p=a_1\), \(a_1=a_2\), … \(a_{p-1}=a_p\). This means that all the elements are the same. So we can write \(X^C\) as $$ \begin{align*} X^C &amp;= \{ (a,a...,a) \ | \ a \in G, aa...a = a^p = e\}. \end{align*} $$ Therefore, the size of this set, is the number of elements in \(G\) which have order \(p\). So $$ \begin{align*} |X^C| &amp;= |\{ a \in G \ | \ a^p = e\}|. \end{align*} $$ We know \(e \in X^C\) since e\(e^p = e\). Moreover, by the Fixed Point Theorem, $$ \begin{align*} |X^C| &amp;\equiv |X| (\bmod p) \\ |X^C| &amp;\equiv 0 (\bmod p) \quad \text{(because $p \ | \ |X|$)} \end{align*} $$ So \(|X^C|\) must be divisible by \(p\) and since \(|X^C| \geq 1\), then \(|X^C| \geq p\). But this means that \(G\) has at least one non-trivial element of order \(p\). \(\ \blacksquare\) Classification of Groups of Order 6 We’ve seen before \(\mathbf{Z}_6 \cong \mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_3\) and we’ve also seen \(D_3 \cong S_3\). Suppose \(|G| = 6 = 2(3)\). These are prime factors, so we can use Cauchy’s Theorem twice to conclude that we must have an element of order 2 and another element of order 3. So let $$ \begin{align*} A &amp;= \langle a \rangle \text{ where $|A| = 2$ } \\ N &amp;= \langle 3 \rangle \text{ where $|N| = 3$} \end{align*} $$ This implies that $$ \begin{align*} [G:N] = \frac{|G|}{|N|} = \frac{6}{3} = 2. \end{align*} $$ But we’ve seen in one of the homeworks, that this implies that \(N\) is normal. We also know the following facts \(N \cap A = \{e\}\) since elements of \(N\) have order 1 or 3 and elements of \(A\) have orders 1 and 2 \(NA\) is a subgroup of \(G\) because one of the groups is normal by Corollary (26.4). By the Diamond Isomorphism Theorem, \(A/A \cap N \cong NA/N\). But since \(A \cap N = \{e\}\). Then \(A \cong NA/N\). This means that \(|NA|/|N| = |A|\). So \(|NA| = |A||N| = 6\) Since \(NA\) is a subgroup of size 6, then it's \(G\) so \(NA = G\) So we know 4 important things \(A\) is a subgroup of \(G\). \(N\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\). \(G = NA\). \(A \cap N = \{e\}\). These are the 4 conditions so we can apply the the recognization theorem to conclude that there exists a homomorphism \(\gamma: A \rightarrow \text{Aut}(N)\) such that there is an isomorphism of groups $$ \begin{align*} N \rtimes_{\gamma} A \cong G \end{align*} $$ \(A\) is of order 2 so it must be isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). \(N\) is of order 3 so it’s isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_3\). We know that \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_3) \cong \Phi(3)\) But \(\Phi(3)\) is of order 2 so it’s isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). So how many homomorphisms can we have from \(A\) to \(\text{Aut}(N)\) if both groups are cyclic of order 2? There are only two choices. The trivial homomorphism gives us the product group \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_3\) The non-trivial homomorphism gives us the dihedral group \(D_3\). Study Notes on \(D_3\) How does the non-trivial homomorphism gives us the dihedral group? how does this happen? We have \(N = \langle n \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_3\) where \(n^3 = e\). \(A = \langle a \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\) where \(a^2 = e\) Define $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_3) \\ \gamma(a) &amp;= \alpha \text{ where } \alpha(n) = n^{-1} \\ \gamma(a)(n) &amp;= n^{-1} \end{align*} $$ So the element \(a \in A\) acts on \(n \in N\) by inverting it. Observe that \(a^2 = e\) and \(\alpha^2 = (n^{-1})^{-1} = \text{id}\) so \(\gamma(\alpha^2) = \gamma(\alpha)^2\). So now multiplication in semi-direct groups is defined as $$ \begin{align*} (n^i, a^j)(n^k, a^l) = (n^i \cdot \gamma_{a^j}(n^k), a^{j}a^{j}) \end{align*} $$ \(a\) has order 2 so \(\gamma_{a^j}(n^k)\) is defined as When \(j = 0\), then \(a^0 = 0\), then \(\gamma_{e} = id\). When \(j = 1\), then \(a^1 = a\), then \(\gamma_{a} = \alpha\) where \(\alpha(n) = n^{-k}\). So now if we apply the semidirect product multiplication, using the homomorphism we defined, we will see that for any \(a\), that we get the relationship \(ana^{-1} = n^{-1}\). Classification of Groups of Order \(2p\) where \(p\) is an odd prime. We know two groups \(\mathbf{Z}_{2p} =\mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{p}\) and \(D_p\). Let \(|G| = 2p\). By Cauchy, \(2\) divides \(|G|\). Therefore, we have an element of order \(2\). From this, we get \(A = \langle a \rangle\) where \(|A| = 2\). We also have an element of order \(p\). From this we get \(N = \langle N \rangle\). Again, we will see that $$ \begin{align*} [G:N] = \frac{|G|}{|N|} = \frac{2p}{p} = 2. \end{align*} $$ Therefore \(N\) is normal. With a similar argument to the previous example. We will see that \(A\) is a subgroup of \(G\). \(N\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\). \(G = NA\). \(A \cap N = \{e\}\). So we can use the recognization theorem again to conclude that there exists a homomorphism \(\gamma: A \rightarrow \text{Aut}(N)\) such that there is an isomorphism of groups $$ \begin{align*} N \rtimes_{\gamma} A \cong G \end{align*} $$ \(A\) is of order 2 so it must be isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). \(N\) is of order \(p\) so it’s isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_p\) (cyclic). We know that \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_p) \cong \Phi(p)\) where \(\Phi(p)\) is of order \(p-1\). So how many homomorphisms can we have from \(A\) to \(\text{Aut}(N)\). The trivial homomorphism gives us the product group \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_p\) The non-trivial homomorphism gives us the dihedral group \(D_p\). Classification of Groups of Order \(pq\) \(p\) and \(q\) are distinct primes where \(p &gt; q\). So again we have \(|G|=pq\). By Cauchy, we have two cyclic subgroups such that $$ \begin{align*} A &amp;= \langle a \rangle \text{ where $|A| = q$ } \\ N &amp;= \langle b \rangle \text{ where $|N| = p$} \end{align*} $$ This implies that $$ \begin{align*} [G:N] = \frac{|G|}{|N|} = q. \end{align*} $$ \(q\) is the smallest prime dividing the order of \(|G|\). By some homework assignment that said that if we have a subgroup of order “the smallest prime dividing the order”, then this subgroup is normal. So now again, \(A\) is a subgroup of \(G\). \(N\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\). \(G = NA\). \(A \cap N = \{e\}\) because \(p \neq q\). So we can use the recognization theorem AGAIN to conclude that there exists a homomorphism \(\gamma: A \rightarrow \text{Aut}(N)\) such that there is an isomorphism of groups $$ \begin{align*} N \rtimes_{\gamma} A \cong G \end{align*} $$ Where $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\ \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_p &amp;\rightarrow \Phi(p) \end{align*} $$ There are two cases: \(q \ \not\mid \ (p-1)\): In this case, the generator of the group \(A\)'s \(q\)th power has to go to the identity because \(q\) doesn't divide \(p - 1\) which is the order of \(\Phi(p)\). The only possible \(\gamma\) is \(\gamma(a) = e\) so send everything to the identity and we get the direct product \(\mathbf{Z}_p \times \mathbf{Z}_q\). \(q \ | \ (p-1)\): So we get the non-trivial homomorphism \(\gamma\). Because \(q \ (p-1)\) which is the order of \(\Phi(p-1)\), then by Cauchy there exists an element of order \(q\) in \(\Phi(p-1)\). So \(\mathbf{Z}_{pq}\) and another non abelian group.

Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Every finite subgroup of \(SO(3)\) is in the list above.
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
\(SO(3)\) acts on \(\mathbf{R}^3\) (we multiply a matrix in \(SO(3)\) by a vector in \(\mathbf{R}^3\)). So now suppose that \(G\) is a subgroup of \(SO(3)\). \(G\) acts on \(\mathbf{R}^3\). We’ll focus on the pole subset in \(\mathbf{R}^3\). What is a poll?
<br />
<br />
A pole for \(G \subseteq SO(3)\) is a unit vector \((u) \in \mathbf{R}^3\) where \(\lVert u \rVert = 1\) such that \(|Stab_G(u)|\geq 2\).
<br />
<br />
In other words, there exists an element \(g\) in \(\text{Stab}_G(u)\) other than the identity such that \(gu = u\). If \(g \neq I\), then \(g = Rot_u(\theta)\) where \(\theta\) is not a multiple of \(2\pi\). Recall, that a rotation in space only fixes vectors along the axis of rotation. But since we constrained this to unit vectors, then it will only fix the unit vector on the axis of rotation. So \(g\) fixes only \(\pm u\). As a consequence, poles come in pairs. If \(u\) is a pole, then \(-u\) is a pole too. So again, a pole is a unit vector in \(\mathbf{R}^3\) that gets fixed by some rotation in \(G\). In other words, \(u\) is a unit vector along the axis of some rotation in \(G\). As a consequence, every non-identity element in \(G\) can contribute 2 poles to the set of poles. If we let \(X\) to be the set of poles, then</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|X| \leq 2(|G| - 1) \quad \text{(-1 for the identity)}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So the set of poles \(X\) is the collection of unit vectors along the axes of rotations of elements in the group \(G\). \(G\) acts on the subset \(X \in \mathbf{R}^3\). For example, if \(g \in G\) and \(x \in X\), then we know that \(gx\) and \(g^{-1}x\) are both in \(X\). Why?
<br />
If \(x\) is a pole, we want to show that \(gx\) is a pole. Since \(x\) is a pole, then we know that \(|\text{Stab}_G(x)| \geq 2\). But we also know that \(\text{Stab}(gx) = g\text{Stab}(x)g^{-1}\) (By HW10, Problem 2). As a consequence, they both have the same size. Therefore, \(|\text{Stab}_G(gx)| \geq 2\). Therefore, \(gx\) is also a pole.
<br />
<br />
Now, since \(G\) acts on the set of poles \(X\), then the set \(X\) decomposes have orbits \(O_1, O_2,...,O_k \subset X\) of the \(G\) action. In the following table, we’re going to list the orbits in decreasing order of their sizes so \(|O_1| \geq |O_2| ... \geq |O_k|\). We will also define \(c_i\) to be the size of the stabilizer in \(G\) of \(x\) for any \(x \in O_i\). Because elements in the same orbit have stabilizers of the same order. We also know that \(|O| = \frac{n}{c_i}\) by the orbits stabilizer theorem.</p>
<ol>
	<li>\(Z_n\): Cyclic groups are rotations around a single axis. We have 2 poles for each direction. The poles end up being in separate orbits. So each orbit is of size 1. So the corresponding stabilizer groups are the whole groups</li>
	<!---------------------------------->
	<li>\(D_m\): \(D_m\) is acting on the set of poles here where a pole is a unit vector such that there is a non-trivial element of \(D_m\) that fixes it. The rotations in \(D_m\) are rotations around the \(z-\)axis. The unit vector along the \(z-\)axis is fixed by all rotations in \(D_m\). So this unit vector \((0,0,1)\) must be in the set of poles and its stabilizer consists of all the rotations in \(D_m\). So it has size \(m\). By the orbits-stabilizer theorem, the size of the orbit is 2. We know it's 2 because \(-u\) is also a pole.
	<br /><br />
	For the reflections, we know from assignment 10 that they are in one orbit. For the flips, these are axes in the \(xy\) plane that we flip around. Each flip, will have two poles associated to them. They live in orbits each of size 2. Notice here that the orbits will be of size \(m\).</li>
	<!---------------------------------->
	<li>\(A_4\): For the regular polyhedra, we also have 3 orbits in each. For the tetrahedron, the orbits are of size 6 (midpoint of edges), 4 (centroid of faces) and 4 (vertex-vertex). We can divide by the $$|G|$$ to get the sizes for the stabilizer. Note here the the number of poles is basically the sum of the orbit sizes since the action breaks the set into disjoint orbits.</li>

</table>
<p>So now we want to know if there is another subgroup \(G\) missing from the table. Let’s use the burnside theorem. We have an action by \(G \leq SO(3)\) on the set of poles \(X\). We don’t know what \(G\) is. The burnside theorem says that number of orbits of this action is</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G} |\text{Fix}(g)|
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>where \(\text{Fix}(g) = \{x \in X \ | \ gx = x \} \subseteq X\) is the set of elements fixed by \(g\). We’ve calculate the number of orbits in the above table. What about \(\text{Fix}(e)\)? It’s everything in \(X\) so</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Fix}(e) = |G| = |O_1| + |O_2| + ... + |O_k|
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>What about any other element in \(G\)? It’s not the identity element so it’s a rotation around some axis. Therefore, it fixes two unit vectors along the axis \(\pm u\) where \(g = Rot_u(\theta)\). In particular, \(\text{Fix}(g) = 2\). So now let’s apply the formula to see that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
k = \frac{1}{n}\big[ |O_1| + ... + |O_k|  + 2(n-1) \big]
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We can simplify this because we know that \(|O_i| = \frac{n}{c_i}\). Therefore</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
k &amp;= \frac{1}{n}\big[ \frac{n}{c_1} + ... + \frac{n}{c_k} + 2(n-1) \big] \\
&amp;= c_1 + ... + c_k + 2 - \frac{2}{n}. 
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We know \(k \geq 0\). We know \(n \geq 1\). We also know that \(c_1,...,c_k\) are integers and they’re all greater than 2. Finally, \(c_i \ | \ n\) because each \(c_i\) is a subgroup. With these constraints, the only solutions are the rows in the table we constructed!!! the is the main step in classifying the finite subgroups in \(SO(3)\).
<br />
<br />
So how do we solve it? For example, say we know we have two orbits each of size 1, so we have two poles. This means that they must be opposite to each other since poles come in pairs. Therefore, everything is rotation around a single axis. Therefore, it must be cyclic. 
<br />
<br />
Step 1: We will show that we can only have 0, 2 or 3 orbits so \(k \in \{0,2,3\}\). Re-write the equations such that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
k &amp;= \frac{1}{n}\big[ \frac{n}{c_1} + ... + \frac{n}{c_k} + 2(n-1) \big] \\
&amp;= c_1 + ... + c_k + 2 - \frac{2}{n} \\
 (1 - \frac{1}{c_i}) + ... + (1 - \frac{1}{c_k}) &amp;= 2 - \frac{2}{n}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>The observation is that \(\frac{2}{n}\) can be between 0 and less than 2. The right hand side, each \(1 - \frac{1}{c}\) needs to be in \([\frac{1}{2},1)\). So \(k\) can’t be 1. If \(k = 4\), then the left hand side is greater than 2 but the right hand side must be less than 2. So \(k\) can’t be 4.
<br />
<br />
Step 2: If \(k = 0\), this gives us \(n = 1\). That’s the trivial group.
<br />
<br />
Step 3: Re-write the equation so that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{2}{n} = \frac{1}{c_1} + \frac{1}{c_2}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This shows …. [TODO .. I’m lost now]

Let’s describe the ones we already know about The trivial subgroup \(\{I\}\). Subgroups that are cyclic so these subgroups are isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). For each \(n\), we have infinitely many subgroups. For example, there are infinitely many cyclic subgroups of order 3 in \(SO(3)\). Pick any axis and consider the rotation by angle \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) around this axis. This makes a subgroup of order 3. So you can get a new subgroup for whatever axis you pick. Therefore, we have infinitely many. In fact, all these subgroups that are rotations by \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) are conjugate (see the lecture before last. If we have a rotation by \(\theta\) around a unit vector \(v\) and we have the same rotation around another unit vector \(u\), then we change \(u\) to \(v\) by some rotation \(A \in SO(3)\). Subgroups isomorphic to the dihedral groups \(D_n\) where \(n \geq 2\). These are symmetries of a regular \(n-\)gon. Pick any \(n-\) and fix one of the vertices on the \(x-\)axis. The symmetries of the \(n-\) is a group isomorphic to \(D_n\). Symmetry group of the tetrahedron which is isomorphic to \(A_4\). Symmetry group of the cube/octahedron which is isomorphic to \(S_4\). Symmetry group of the icosahedron/dodecahedron which is isomorphic to \(A_5\). In fact we have the following theorem Theorem Every finite subgroup of \(SO(3)\) is in the list above. Proof \(SO(3)\) acts on \(\mathbf{R}^3\) (we multiply a matrix in \(SO(3)\) by a vector in \(\mathbf{R}^3\)). So now suppose that \(G\) is a subgroup of \(SO(3)\). \(G\) acts on \(\mathbf{R}^3\). We’ll focus on the pole subset in \(\mathbf{R}^3\). What is a poll? A pole for \(G \subseteq SO(3)\) is a unit vector \((u) \in \mathbf{R}^3\) where \(\lVert u \rVert = 1\) such that \(|Stab_G(u)|\geq 2\). In other words, there exists an element \(g\) in \(\text{Stab}_G(u)\) other than the identity such that \(gu = u\). If \(g \neq I\), then \(g = Rot_u(\theta)\) where \(\theta\) is not a multiple of \(2\pi\). Recall, that a rotation in space only fixes vectors along the axis of rotation. But since we constrained this to unit vectors, then it will only fix the unit vector on the axis of rotation. So \(g\) fixes only \(\pm u\). As a consequence, poles come in pairs. If \(u\) is a pole, then \(-u\) is a pole too. So again, a pole is a unit vector in \(\mathbf{R}^3\) that gets fixed by some rotation in \(G\). In other words, \(u\) is a unit vector along the axis of some rotation in \(G\). As a consequence, every non-identity element in \(G\) can contribute 2 poles to the set of poles. If we let \(X\) to be the set of poles, then $$ \begin{align*} |X| \leq 2(|G| - 1) \quad \text{(-1 for the identity)} \end{align*} $$ So the set of poles \(X\) is the collection of unit vectors along the axes of rotations of elements in the group \(G\). \(G\) acts on the subset \(X \in \mathbf{R}^3\). For example, if \(g \in G\) and \(x \in X\), then we know that \(gx\) and \(g^{-1}x\) are both in \(X\). Why? If \(x\) is a pole, we want to show that \(gx\) is a pole. Since \(x\) is a pole, then we know that \(|\text{Stab}_G(x)| \geq 2\). But we also know that \(\text{Stab}(gx) = g\text{Stab}(x)g^{-1}\) (By HW10, Problem 2). As a consequence, they both have the same size. Therefore, \(|\text{Stab}_G(gx)| \geq 2\). Therefore, \(gx\) is also a pole. Now, since \(G\) acts on the set of poles \(X\), then the set \(X\) decomposes have orbits \(O_1, O_2,...,O_k \subset X\) of the \(G\) action. In the following table, we’re going to list the orbits in decreasing order of their sizes so \(|O_1| \geq |O_2| ... \geq |O_k|\). We will also define \(c_i\) to be the size of the stabilizer in \(G\) of \(x\) for any \(x \in O_i\). Because elements in the same orbit have stabilizers of the same order. We also know that \(|O| = \frac{n}{c_i}\) by the orbits stabilizer theorem. \(Z_n\): Cyclic groups are rotations around a single axis. We have 2 poles for each direction. The poles end up being in separate orbits. So each orbit is of size 1. So the corresponding stabilizer groups are the whole groups \(D_m\): \(D_m\) is acting on the set of poles here where a pole is a unit vector such that there is a non-trivial element of \(D_m\) that fixes it. The rotations in \(D_m\) are rotations around the \(z-\)axis. The unit vector along the \(z-\)axis is fixed by all rotations in \(D_m\). So this unit vector \((0,0,1)\) must be in the set of poles and its stabilizer consists of all the rotations in \(D_m\). So it has size \(m\). By the orbits-stabilizer theorem, the size of the orbit is 2. We know it's 2 because \(-u\) is also a pole. For the reflections, we know from assignment 10 that they are in one orbit. For the flips, these are axes in the \(xy\) plane that we flip around. Each flip, will have two poles associated to them. They live in orbits each of size 2. Notice here that the orbits will be of size \(m\). \(A_4\): For the regular polyhedra, we also have 3 orbits in each. For the tetrahedron, the orbits are of size 6 (midpoint of edges), 4 (centroid of faces) and 4 (vertex-vertex). We can divide by the $$|G|$$ to get the sizes for the stabilizer. Note here the the number of poles is basically the sum of the orbit sizes since the action breaks the set into disjoint orbits.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lecture 29: Burnside Formula</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/21/math417-29-burnside-formula.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lecture 29: Burnside Formula" /><published>2025-02-21T00:01:36-08:00</published><updated>2025-02-21T00:01:36-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/21/math417-29-burnside-formula</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/21/math417-29-burnside-formula.html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we will discuss a formula for counting orbits calling the burnside formula. The book illustrates this with a necklace beads counting example. So how many necklaces are there with two orange, two blue beads? If we count naively, we have 4 slots. The two blue beads will go into two of the slots. So there are \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\) to do this. Then the orange beads will get the remaining two spots. So</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec29/1.png" width="90%" class="center" /></p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
X = \{OOBB, OBOB, OBBO, BOBO, BOOB, BBOO\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>But that’s not right. There are only 2 distinct elements. This in fact is the same as counting orbits of a group action. 2 here is the number of orbits of a group action. The group action is</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
G = \{ D_4 \}, |G| = 8 \quad \text{acts on } X = \text{ The set of linear arrangements where $|X|=6$}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>To see this, imagine the beads moving by 90 degrees (which is the rotation \(r\)) to get the next shape in the picture. The symmetries of the beads are the same as the symmetries of the dihedral group. We can also flip the necklace on the \(x\)-axis which is the same as the flip \(j \in D_4\). Now, the orbits of this action are as follows</p>

<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<p>How many necklaces with 9 beads: 4 red, 3 white, 2 yellow? This isn’t an easy question. But there is an easier question which is counting the linear arrangements of the 9 beads with the colors we have. Let \(X\) be the set of linear arrangements of 9 beads with 4 red, 3 while, 2 yellow. If they were all of different colors, then there will be \(9!\) arrangements. But only have 3 colors so some of the beads are indistinguishable. Therefore, we have</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|X| = \frac{9!}{4!3!2!} = 1260.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So it’s impossible to physically see which arrangements will unique. We said earlier that this is equivalent to having an action by \(D_9\) on the set \(X\). So we just to count the orbits of this action with something called the burnside formula.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Burnside Formula</b></h4>
<p>First, we need the following notation</p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Action by \(G\) on \(X\)
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Given \(g \in G\), let \(\text{Fix}(g) = \{x \in X \ | \ gx = x \} \subseteq X \) be the set of elements fixed by \(g\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
For example \(Fix(e) = X\). Now,
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Burnside Formula
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(G\) acts on a set \(X\), and \(|G| &lt; \infty, |X| &lt; \infty\). Then, the number of orbits is
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G} |\text{Fix}(g)|
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<p>Let’s apply the formula on Example 1. We had \(G = D_4 = \{e,r,r^2,j,rj,r^2j\}\) where \(|G| = 8\) and \(|X| = 6\). For example, take \(r\). We want to know the arrangements that are fixed by \(r\) (the rotation by 90 degrees). What does it mean for an arrangement to be fixed by \(r\). It means that the arrangement when rotated by 90 degrees, it will still be the same arrangement. Observe what happens to the following arrangement.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec29/3.png" width="55%" class="center" /></p>
<p>This arrangement is not fixed by \(r\). In fact, all the beads have to have the same color for \(r\) to be able to fix them. So the fix set is zero for \(r\). Note here that \(r^{-1} = r^{3}\) will have the same result for the same reason.
<br />
<br />
What about \(r^2\) so a rotation by 180 degrees. Observe what happens to the following arrangement</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec29/4.png" width="55%" class="center" /></p>
<p>So the beads on the opposite sides have to have the same color for the arrangement to work. We have two arrangements exactly of this kind. So \(|Fix(r^2)| = 2\)
<br />
<br />
What about \(j\)? Let \(j\) be the flip across the \(x\)-axis. Here, for the arrangement to be fixed, notice that the beads on the axis will not change. So we just need the top and bottom beads to have the same color. The number of arrangements with this condition is 2. In fact, \(r^2j\) (flip around the \(y\)-axis) will have the same number of arrangement fixed.
<br />
<br />
\(rj\) is a flip around the axis \(x=y\). So the beads on either side of the following axis must have the same color just like following picture</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec29/5.png" width="25%" class="center" /></p>

<p>In summary,</p>
<table style="max-width: 400px; margin: 20px auto;">

<p>So now let’s apply the burnside formula</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{number of orbits } &amp;= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G} |\text{Fix}(g)| \\
                         &amp;= \frac{1}{8}(6+0+2+0+2+2+2+2) \\

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<p>Here, we had \(G = D_9 = \{e, r, r^2, ..., r^8, j, rj, ..., r^8j\}\). Recall that \(|X| = 1260\). Doing the same analysis</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(e\): This is just the entire group so \(|\text{Fix}(e)| = 1260\).</li>
	<li>\(r\): Like before, we can't fix anything with a 90 degrees rotation. All the beads have to have the same color. This is the same for its inverse \(r^8\).</li>
	<li>\(r^2\): Note that \(r^2\) has order 9 as well. No possible arrangements here as well. In fact, the same thing happens with \(r^4\) and its inverse \(r^5\).</li>
	<li>\(r^3\): We have 9 beads. Here we need every third bead to match colors. So like in the following picture
	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec29/6.png" width="45%" class="center" /></p>
	So vertices 1,4 and 7 have to have the same color. Vertices 2, 5 and 8 have to have the same color. Same for vertices 3, 6 and 9. But we recall that we have 4 red beads, 3 white beads, and 2 yellow beads.
	</li>
	<li>\(j\): A flip around the \(x\)-axis. So now there is a black bead fixed by the access itself and the remaining beads must match as follows
	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec29/7.png" width="45%" class="center" /></p>
	We have 4 red beads, 3 white beads and 2 yellow. So the fixed bead must be a white bead. So now we have the remaining two whites. We need to put one white bead in one of the 4 slots (say in the bottom). We have 4 slots so 4 choices for the second white bead. Next, if we place the yellow bead, we'll have 3 slots available to choose from. Lastly, we have 2 red beads so they must go in the remaining slots. So 12 choices total.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>So now let’s apply the burnside formula</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{number of orbits } &amp;= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G} |\text{Fix}(g)| \\
                         &amp;= \frac{1}{18}(1260+9(12)) \\

<h4><b>Proof of Burnside Formula</b></h4>
<p>Let \(F = \{(g,x) \ | \ g \in G, x \in X, gx = x\}\). (So we’re writing it differently than before but it’s the same. We’re just counting any element that gets fixed by any \(g\). So all of them). We’re going to count this set in two different ways</p>
<ol>
	<li>\(|F| = \sum_{g \in G} | x \in X \ | \ gx = x \} = \sum_{g \in G} |\text{Fix}(g)| \)</li>
	<li>\(|F| = \sum_{x \in X} | g \in G \ | \ gx = X \} = \sum_{x \in X} |\text{Stab}(g)| \)</li>
</ol>
<p>From this, observe that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} |\text{Fix}(g)| &amp;= \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{x \in X} |\text{Stab}(g)| \\
                                             &amp;= \sum_{x \in X} \frac{|\text{Stab}(g)|}{|G|}.

<h4><b>Example 3 (Variant of Example 2)</b></h4>
<p>Consider example 2 again. We had a fixed number of beads (4 red, 3 white, 2 yellow). Now, suppose that we don’t have a constraint on the count for each color. We just want a necklace made of 3 colors and 9 beads. Then \(G = D_9\) acts on \(X\) which is the linear arrangements of beads of 3 colors. What is the size of \(X\)? The first bead can be any of the three colors, the second bead can be any of the three colors and so on. So</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|X| = 3^9 = 19,683								 
\end{align*}
$$
</div>

<p>Here, we had \(G = D_9 = \{e, r, r^2, ..., r^8, j, rj, ..., r^8j\}\). Recall that \(|X| = 1260\). Doing the same analysis</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(e\): This is just the entire group so \(|\text{Fix}(e)| = 1260\).
	</li>
	<li>\(r\): Like before, we can't fix anything with a 90 degrees rotation. All the beads have to have the same color. This is the same for its inverse \(r^8\) and as well as \(r^2, r^4, r^5\).
	</li>
	<li>\(r^3\): We have 9 beads. Again we need every third bead to have the same color. We have three groups. Each group will need to be of the same color and it can be any color so 3 choices for every group. Therefore, we have \(3^3 = 27\) choices.
	</li>
	<li>\(j\): A flip around the \(x\)-axis. Like before, we had a bead fixed on the axis and 4 other groups of two beads each that needed to match colors. Each of these has a choice of 3 colors so \(3^5\) choices.
	</li>
</ul>

The book illustrates this with a necklace beads counting example. So how many necklaces are there with two orange, two blue beads? If we count naively, we have 4 slots. The two blue beads will go into two of the slots. So there are \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\) to do this. Then the orange beads will get the remaining two spots. So $$ \begin{align*} X = \{OOBB, OBOB, OBBO, BOBO, BOOB, BBOO\} \end{align*} $$ But that’s not right. There are only 2 distinct elements. This in fact is the same as counting orbits of a group action. 2 here is the number of orbits of a group action. The group action is $$ \begin{align*} G = \{ D_4 \}, |G| = 8 \quad \text{acts on } X = \text{ The set of linear arrangements where $|X|=6$} \end{align*} $$ To see this, imagine the beads moving by 90 degrees (which is the rotation \(r\)) to get the next shape in the picture. The symmetries of the beads are the same as the symmetries of the dihedral group. We can also flip the necklace on the \(x\)-axis which is the same as the flip \(j \in D_4\).

<h4><b>Conjugation by \(G\) on \(X = G\)</b></h4>
<p>The next thing we talked about was the conjugation action when the set \(G\) acted on was the set \(G\) itself. This was defined as</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	c: G &amp;\rightarrow Aut(G) \leq Sym(G) \\
	c(g)(x) &amp;= gxg^{-1}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We defined this action last lecture from \(G\) to \(Sym(G)\) but in fact, \(c\) is a homomorphism from \(G\) to \(Aut(G)\). \(Aut(G)\) is a subgroup of \(Sym(G)\). The conjugation action is the one that’s really useful for understanding things about a group \(G\). 
<br />
<br />
The <b>orbits</b> of the conjugation action are called <b>conjugacy classes.</b></p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	Cl(x) = \{gxg^{-1} \ | \ g \in G\}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We also studied <b>centralizers</b> and these are the <b>centralizers</b> of the action. So</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\text{Cent}(x) &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gxg^{-1} = x\} \\
	               &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gx= xg\} .
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>In other words, the centralizers are those elements that commute with the element \(x\). Using the orbit/stabilizer theorem</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|Cl(x)| &amp;= [G: \text{Cent}(x)]
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Additionally, the kernel of \(c\) is what we call the center \(c\). It’s the collection of elements that commute with every other element in the group. So</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	Ker(c) = Z(G) &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gh = hg \ \forall h \in G \} \\
	              &amp;= \bigcap_{x \in G} \text{Cent}(x)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>What is the conjugacy class of the identity? It’s always \(Cl(e) = \{e\}\). This means that the conjugation action is never transitive unless we’re acting on the trivial group. Since if \(G\) contains other elements, then they’ll be in a different orbit.
<br />
<br />
Now, suppose that \(b \in Z(G)\). So \(b\) commutes with every other element in \(G\). What is the conjugacy class of \(b\). It is \(Cl(b) = \{b\}\). Why? since \(b\) commutes with every element \(g\) in \(G\), then \(Cl(b) = \{gbg^{-1} \ | \ g \in G\}\) but</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	gbg^{-1} = gg^{-1}b = b
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So \(Cl\) contains only \(b\). So if you’re in the center, then the conjugacy class contains only you. The other way direction is true. If \(Cl(g) = \{g\}\), \(g \in Z(G)\). 
<br />
<br />
Consequence: If \(G\) is abelian, then \(Z(G) = G\) and every conjugacy class in \(G\) in its own class. So \(Cl(g) = \{g\}\) for all \(g \in G\). What about the stabilizer or Center\((g)\)? It’s also all of \(G\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Conjugacy Classes in \(SO(3)\)</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = SO(3) = \{Rot_u(\theta)\}\) where \(u\) is a unit vector. \(Rot_u(\theta)\) is a rotation by angle \(\theta\) around the unit vector \(u\). Recall</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 Rot_u(\theta + 2\pi n) &amp;= Rot_u(\theta), n \in \mathbf{Z} \\
	 Rot_{-u}(\theta) &amp;= Rot_{u}(-\theta) \\
	 Rot_{u}(0) &amp;= I
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>

<p>How do we conjugate elements in this group? Recall from lecture 2? that if \(A \in SO(3)\), then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	ARot_u(\theta)A^{-1} = Rot_{Au}(\theta)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So if we conjugate the rotation by matrix \(A\), we get another rotation but now it’s about the axis \(Au\) instead of \(u\). This is the conjugation formula for elements in \(SO(3)\).
<br />
<br />
So now, what are the conjugacy classes of \(SO(3)\)</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	Cl(Rot_u(\theta)) &amp;= \{A Rot_u(\theta)A^{-1} \ | \ A \in SO(3)\} \\
	                  &amp;= \{A Rot_{Au}(\theta) \ | \ A \in SO(3)\} \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>For example. Take the identity mattress. What is the conjugacy class of the identity element?</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	Cl(Rot_u(0)) = Cl(I) &amp;= I
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>What about a non-identity matrix? so \(\theta\) is not zero. Fix a unit vector in space. What vectors do we get if we act on it by \(A\)? Suppose we limit \(\theta\) to \((0, 2\pi)\). Then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	Cl(Rot_u(0)) = \{Rot_v(\theta), v \in \mathbf{R}, \lVert v \rVert = 1 \}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This means that we get all the rotations with the same \(\theta\) but the axis is changing to a different unit vector. 
<br />
<br />
Note: Both \(Rot_u(\theta)\) and \(Rot_u(-\theta)\) are in the same conjugacy class. For example, \(Rot_{e_3}(-120) = Rot_{-e_3}(120)\). The exception is 180 degrees because \(Rot_u(\pi) = Rot_u(-\pi)\). [Side note: Given two rotations \(Rot_{u_1}(\theta)\) and \(Rot_{u_2}(\theta)\) that have the same angle but different axes. They are in the same conjugacy class if \(u_1\) can be rotated into \(u_2\) by an element in \(SO(3)\)].
<br />
<br />
The centralizer of the identity is any element that commutes with the identity element. So it’s easy to see that \(\text{Cent}(x) = SO(3)\). What about the centralizer of \(Rot_u(\theta)\) where \(\theta \in (0,2\pi)\). We’re looking for elements such that \(ARot_u(\theta)A^{-1} = Rot_{Au}(\theta)\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\text{Cent}(Rot_u(\theta)) = \{A = Rot_u(\alpha) \ | \ \alpha \in \mathbf{R}\} 
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is because rotations around the same axis commute with each other. There is exception for  \(\pi = 180\) because in addition to all the arbitrary rotations around the same axis, we also get another set which is the 180 rotations around any vector such that \(u \cdot v = 0\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\text{Cent}(Rot_u(\theta) = \{A = Rot_u(\alpha) \ | \ \alpha \in \mathbf{R}\} \cup \{Rot_v(\pi) \ | \ \text{any } v \text{ such that } v \cdot u = 0\}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Study notes since I was confused here. The idea is that for any rotation in \(SO(3)\), we have a conjugation formula that states \(ARot_u(\theta)A^{-1} = Rot_{Au}(\theta)\). This means that rotation about the axis \(u\) by \(\theta\) and then rotating by \(A\) is the same as rotating about the axis \(Au\) by the same angle. This tells us that two rotations in \(SO(3)\) are conjugate if it’s the same angle and if they can be related by some matrix \(A\). So now the questions is? given some unit vector \(u\)? and given a rotation around \(u\) by angle \(\theta\). Are we guaranteed to find another vector \(v\) such that \(ARot_u(\theta)A^{-1} = Rot_{Au}(\theta)\)? The answer is yes for \(SO(3)\) specifically. For any two unit vectors \(u\) and \(v\), there exists an \(A\) such that \(Au = v\). Therefore, if we keep the same angle, then all the rotations by another other vector \(v\) around the same angle are in the same conjugacy class as the rotation around the original vector by \(\theta\).

</div>
<p>For example, for the diagonals between vertices. We have 4 diagonals but for each diagonal we could rotate by \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) or \(-\frac{2\pi}{3}\). So we have 8 symmetries of that kind. We also have the axes that goes through opposite edges. Those have to be of 180 degrees rotations. We have 6 of them. Finally we have the ones that goes through the faces. We have two types of these. The quarter turns which can go \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) in either clockwise or counter clockwise and then we have the half turn rotations which are 180 degrees. Since we have 6 faces, then we have 3 axes. For the quarter turns, we have (2*3) symmetries and for the half turns, we have \(3\) symmetries.
<br />
<br />
In fact, these are exactly the conjugacy classes of the cube (5 classes). But we said earlier that rotations with the same angle but different axis are all going to be in the same conjugacy class in \(SO(3)\). So why do we have for example, two classes that have rotations by 180 degrees here (look at the edge/edge and face/face). While they are conjugate in \(SO(3)\), they are not conjugate in \(G\) (cube). Reminder, the conjugation formula is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	ARot_u(\theta)A^{-1} = Rot_{Au}(\theta)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>What we want is an \(A\) such that it sends \(u\) to \(Au\). We don’t have that in the cube.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Conjugacy Classes of \(\S_n\)</b></h4>
<p>We have formula already for this</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	g(a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ g_k)g^{-1} = (g(a_1) \ g(a_2) \ ... \ g(a_k))
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So we get another \(k-\)cycle.
<br />
<br />
Example: suppose $\sigma = (1 \ 2 \ 3)(4 \ 5)\(and we want to conjugate by\)g = (1 \ 5 \ 2 \ 4 \ 6)$$. Then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	g(1 \ 2 \ 3)(4 \ 5)g^{-1} &amp;= g(1 \ 2 \ 3)g^{-1 } \circ g(4 \ 5)g^{-1} \\
	                          &amp;= (g(1) \ g(2) \ g(3)) \circ (g(4) \ g(5)) \\
							  &amp;= (5 \ 4 \ 3)(6 \ 2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Observation: If we start with a product of disjoint cycles and we conjugate by some element, then we get the same exact cycle type (a product of the same cycle type). Conjugation preserves the cycle type. Conversely if we have two products of the same cycle type, we can find some \(g\) takes us from one one element to the other. This leads to the following fact</p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Fact
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
The conjugacy class of an element \(g\) is all elements of the same cycle type of \(g\).
</div>
<p><br />
For example, consider \(S_4\). Take the cycle type \((a \ b)\). There are \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\) choices for the two elements. We can arrange them in \(2!\) but we need to divide by 2 since \((a \ b) = (b \ a)\). Therefore, we have \(6 * 2! / 2 = 6\) distinct permutations. We can consider \((a \ b \ c)\) next. We have 4 choices for the elements but we need to multiply by \(3!\) and divide by 3 to get 8. For \((a \ b)(c \ d)\). We have \(binom{4}{2}\) for the first cycle but then we need to multiply by \(2!\) and divide by 2. So we get 6 elements. For the second cycle, we have \(\binom{2}{2}*2!/2 = 1\) element. But then we also need to divide by \(2\) since \((a \ b)(c \ d) = (c \ d)(a \ b)\). So the total is \(6 * 1 / 2 = 3\).

So $$ \begin{align*} Ker(c) = Z(G) &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gh = hg \ \forall h \in G \} \\ &amp;= \bigcap_{x \in G} \text{Cent}(x) \end{align*} $$ Examples What is the conjugacy class of the identity? It’s always \(Cl(e) = \{e\}\). This means that the conjugation action is never transitive unless we’re acting on the trivial group. Since if \(G\) contains other elements, then they’ll be in a different orbit. Now, suppose that \(b \in Z(G)\). So \(b\) commutes with every other element in \(G\). What is the conjugacy class of \(b\). It is \(Cl(b) = \{b\}\). Why? since \(b\) commutes with every element \(g\) in \(G\), then \(Cl(b) = \{gbg^{-1} \ | \ g \in G\}\) but $$ \begin{align*} gbg^{-1} = gg^{-1}b = b \end{align*} $$ So \(Cl\) contains only \(b\). So if you’re in the center, then the conjugacy class contains only you. The other way direction is true. If \(Cl(g) = \{g\}\), \(g \in Z(G)\). Consequence: If \(G\) is abelian, then \(Z(G) = G\) and every conjugacy class in \(G\) in its own class. So \(Cl(g) = \{g\}\) for all \(g \in G\). What about the stabilizer or Center\((g)\)? It’s also all of \(G\). Conjugacy Classes in \(SO(3)\) Let \(G = SO(3) = \{Rot_u(\theta)\}\) where \(u\) is a unit vector. \(Rot_u(\theta)\) is a rotation by angle \(\theta\) around the unit vector \(u\). Recall $$ \begin{align*} Rot_u(\theta + 2\pi n) &amp;= Rot_u(\theta), n \in \mathbf{Z} \\ Rot_{-u}(\theta) &amp;= Rot_{u}(-\theta) \\ Rot_{u}(0) &amp;= I \end{align*} $$]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lecture 26/27: Group Actions and Orbits</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/19/math417-26-orbits.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lecture 26/27: Group Actions and Orbits" /><published>2025-02-19T00:01:36-08:00</published><updated>2025-02-19T00:01:36-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/19/math417-26-orbits</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/19/math417-26-orbits.html"><![CDATA[<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Group Actions

<div class="mintbodydiv">
A group action by a group \(G\) on a set \(X\) is a homomorphism
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi: G \rightarrow Sym(X)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Note here that for every element in the group \(G\) and every element in the set \(X\), we get a function \(\phi(g)\). This function is from \(x \rightarrow X\). Because it is a function, then we can plug in a value \(x\) such that \(\phi(g)(x) \in X\). Moreover,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi(e)(x) &amp;= x \quad \text{ because $\varphi(e)$ is the identity function } \\
\varphi(g_1g_2)(x) &amp;= (\varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2))(x) \quad \text{because $\phi$ is a homomorphism} \\ 
                &amp;= \varphi(g_1)\big(\varphi(g_2)(x)\big)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Additionally, these identities force \(\varphi(g^{-1}) = \varphi(g)^{-1}\) which means that \(\varphi(g)\) is a bijection.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Alternate Notation</b></h4>
<p>Given \(g \in G\) and \(x \in X\), write \(gx\) for \(\varphi(g)(x)\). So now we get a function</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
G \times X &amp;\rightarrow X \\
(g,x) &amp;\rightarrow gx = \varphi(g)(x)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Re-writing the previous identities with the new notation:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
ex &amp;= x \quad \forall x \in X \\
(g_1g_2)x &amp;= g_1(g_2x) \quad \forall g_1,g_2 \in G, x \in X
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Tautological action by \(G = Sym(X)\) on X. What is this function?</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi: Sym(x) \xrightarrow{\text{identity function}} Sym(x)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This just gives us \(\varphi(g)=g\). This is exactly what we use when we work with permutations. A permutation is a function from \(X\) to itself. So for \(g \in G\) and \(x \in X\), we apply it like \(g(x) = gx\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Suppose \(G = SO(3)\) which acts on \(X = \mathbf{R}^3\). The action rule is given by</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
G \times X &amp;\rightarrow X \\

<h4><b>Orbits</b></h4>
<p>Next, we’ll define something called an orbit of action by \(G\) on \(X\).</p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Orbit of Action by \(G\) on \(X\) 
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
An Orbit is a subset of \(X\) of the form 
$$
\begin{align*}
O(x) = \{gx \ | \ g \in G\}, \quad \text{for some } x \in X
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br />
Fact: orbits are equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on \(X\). So \(x \sim y\) if and only if there is some \(g \in G\) such that \(gx = y\). So, \(O(x)O(y) = \emptyset\) or \(O(x) = O(y)\). Therefore, orbits partition \(X\) into pairwise disjoint and nonempty subsets. One more fact: We action is called transitive if there is only one orbit so \(O(x) = X\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Stabilizers</b></h4>
<p>One more defintion.</p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Stabilizer
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
For each \(x \in X\)
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Stab}(x) = \text{Stab}_G(y) = \{g \in \ | \ gx = x\}
\end{align*}
$$
These are the set of elements of \(G\) that "fix" x.
</div>
<p><br />
Some facts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(\text{Stab}(x) \leq G\)</li>
	<li>If \(x, y \in X\) and these elements are related such that for some \(g \in G\), we have \(y = gx\), then \(\text{Stab}(y) = g\text{Stab}(x)g^{-1}\). So if \(x\) and \(y\) are in the same orbit, then their stabilizer subgroups are conjugate.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Kernel of Action</b></h4>
<p>What is the kernel of a group action? By definition, the kernel contains all the elements in \(g\) such that \(\varphi(x)\) is the identity transformation</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\ker(\varphi) = \{g \in G \ | \ gx = x \quad \text{for all } x \in X\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Of course this looks exactly like the definition of a stabilizer that we just did. So,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\ker(\varphi) = \bigcap_{x \in X} \text{Stab}(x) \unlhd G
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We say that the action is faithful if \(\ker(\varphi) = \{e\}\). This is is the same as saying the homomorphism \(G \rightarrow Sym(x)\) is injective.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<p>Suppose \(G = D_n\) which acts on \(X = \{v_0,v_1,...,v_{n-1}\}\). The action rule is given by the homomorphism</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\phi: D_n &amp;\rightarrow Sym(X) = S_n
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>For example. Suppose \(G = D_3 = \{e, r, r^2, j, rj, r^2j\}\) with \(V = \{v_0, v_1, v_2\}\).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec27/triangle.png" width="45%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Given this setup. What are the orbits of the action? Pick one vertex like \(v_0\). What is the orbit of \(v_0\)? If we start with \(v_0\), then we can reach every other vertex so</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
rv_0 &amp;= v_1 \\
rv_1 &amp;= r^2v_0 = v_2
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So the orbit of \(v_0\) is \(O(v_0) = \{v_0, v_1, v_2\}\). So there is only one orbit and in this case the action is transitive. What about the stabilizers? these are the set of elements of \(G\) that fix \(x\). For example, if we take \(v_0\), then we know that \(e\) fixes \(x\) so it’s in the set. Is there any other element such that if we hit \(x\) with it, we get \(x\) back? Notice that \(j\) does that since \(v_0\) is on the flip axis. We can do the same calculation for \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) to see that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Stab}(v_0) &amp;= \{e,j\} \\
\text{Stab}(v_1) &amp;= \{e,r^2j\} \\
\text{Stab}(v_2) &amp;= \{e, rj\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<p>Let’s take another example. Suppose that \(G = SO(3)\) and \(X = \mathbf{R}^3\). Take the action given by the homomorphism</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
SO(3) &amp;\rightarrow Sym(\mathbf{R}^3) \\
A,x &amp;= Ax
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>What is the orbit of \(v\)? Take a unit vector and compute its orbit under the action of \(SO(3)\). We elements do we get when we rotate this vector by any rotation in \(SO(3)\)? What vector do we get? We get another unit vector. In fact, given a vector with norm \(\lVert R \rVert = R\), we will get</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
O(v) = \{x \in \mathbf{R}^3 \ | \ \lVert x \rVert = R \}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We get the set of vectors in \(\mathbf{R}^3\) with length \(R\). So a sphere of radius \(R\) centered at the origin. (Except for the zero vector where its orbit is 0 so \(O(0) = \{0\}\)). 
<br />
<br />
What about the stabilizers? If \(v\) is the zero vector, that’s easy because it’s all of \(SO(3)\). Any matrix \(A\) satisfies \(A0 = 0\). But for non-zero vectors, its the rotations of any angle around an axis through \(v\).</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Stab}(0) &amp;= SO(3) \\
\text{Stab}(v) &amp;= \{Rot_u(O), O \in \mathbf{R}\}, \quad u = v/\lVert v \rVert
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Is this a faithful? Is there any matrix \(A\) that fixes every vector \(v\) besides \(I\)? No, in fact, the kernel has only the identity matrix.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />

<h4><b>Orbit Stabilizer Theorem</b></h4>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Orbit Stabilizer Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group that acts on \(X\). If \(x \in X\), then there is a bijection
$$
\begin{align*}
G/H &amp;\rightarrow O(x), \quad \text{where } H = \text{Stab}(x) \\
\end{align*}
$$
\(G/H\) is the set \(\{gH\}\) of left \(H\)-cosets.
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
A consequence of this theorem is a formula for the size of the orbit</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|O(x)| = [G: \text{Stab}(x)]
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This is useful when the group is finite. So when it’s finite, then \(|O(x)| = \frac{|G|}{\text{Stab}(x)}|\). So the size of any orbit has to divide the order of the group.
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We need to give a bijection. Consider the formula that takes a left coset \(gH\) to what you get when you apply the action on \(x\).</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\alpha: G/H &amp;\rightarrow O(x) \\
        \alpha(gH) &amp;= gx
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Step 1 involves showing that this is well defined. So given that \(gH = g'H\), then \(gx = g'x\). The reason why they would be equal is that \(H\) is simply the stabilizer \(\text{Stab}(x)\). Step 2 is showing that this is indeed a bijection.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Actions by \(G\) on \(X = G\)</b></h4>
<p>Suppose you have a group \(G\). What will happen if it acts on its own set. So</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi: G &amp;\rightarrow Sym(G)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>There several of these. For example, we have the Left Regular Action. This is given by the homomorphism</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\lambda: G &amp;\rightarrow Sym(G) \\
	\lambda(g)(x) &amp;= gx, \quad g,x \in G
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>What are the orbits of this action? For example, the orbit of \(e\) is everything</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	O(e) = \{\lambda(g)(e), g \in G\} = \{ge, g \in G\} = G = X
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>What about the stabilizers?</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Stab}(x) = \{g \in G \ | \ gx = x \} = \{e\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>A consequence of this is that the kernel of the action is, \(\ker(\lambda) = \{e\}\). Therefore, we have a faithful action. This actually led to the next big theorem which is Cayley’s Theorem
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Cayley's Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Every finite group \(G\) is isomorphic to a subgroup of some symmetric group \(S_m\)
</div>
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Use the left regular action \(\lambda: G \rightarrow Sym(G) \cong S_n\). This is a faithful action which means that this action is injective. Therefore, \(G\) is isomorphic to the image subgroup which is \(Sym_n\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Right Regular and Conjugate Actions</b></h4>
<p>We also have a Right Regular Action (though we won’t use it)</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\rho: G &amp;\rightarrow Sym(G) \\
	\rho(g)(x) &amp;= xg^{-1}, \quad g,x \in G
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>And the Conjugate Action</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	c: G &amp;\rightarrow Sym(G) \\
	c(g)(x) &amp;= gxg^{-1}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is an action \(c(g_1) \circ c(g_2) = c(g_1g_2)\). The orbits of the conjugation action are called conjugacy classes. For example, if we have \(x \in X \in G\), then the conjugacy class of \(x\) is. It is a subset of the group \(G\)</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	Cl(x) = \{gxg^{-1} \ | \ g \in G\}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>For the stabilizers, if we have \(x \in X = G\), then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\text{Cent}(x) &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gxg^{-1} = x \} \\
	        &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gx = xg \}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The kernel</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	Ker(c) = Z(G) &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gx = xg \ \forall x \in G \} \\
	              &amp;= \bigcap_{x \in G} \text{Cent}(x)
	\end{align*}
	$$

<p>We actually do a relavent Theorem here
<br /></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Orbits/Stabilizers

<div class="yellowbodydiv">
When \(G\) is finite, then \(|Cl(x)| = \frac{|G|}{|\text{Cent}(x)|}\)
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Suppose \(G = D_3 = \{e, r, r^2, j, rj, r^2j\}\). We want to compute the orbits which are now the conjugacy classes for each element. For example, the orbit/conjugacy class of the identity is just the identity, since conjugating the identity by any element in \(g\) gives us the identity back.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
geg^{-1} &amp;= e \quad \forall g \in G, \quad Cl(e) = \{e\} 
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>For \(r\) we we can try conjugating by every element of \(g\) but we will see that we will always get \(r\) and \(r^2\) back.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
rrr^{-1} &amp;= r \\
jrj^{-1} &amp;= r^{-1} = r^2
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Therefore, \(Cl(r) = \{r, r^2\}\). Finally, let’s find the conjugacy class of \(j\)</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
rjr^{-1} &amp;= rrj = r^2j \\
jjj &amp;= j \\
rjj(rj)^{-1} &amp;= rjr^{-1} = rrj = r^2j \\
...
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We’ll get \(Cl(j) = \{j, rj, r^2j\}\). Now, we can do the stabilizers. The stabilizer of \(e\) is any element that \(e\) fixes so it’s all of \(G\). What about \(r\)?</p>
<ul>
	<li> By the previous theorem, \(|Cl(x)| = \frac{|G|}{|\text{Cent}(x)|}\). Since \(|Cl(r)|=2\), then we must have three elements in the centralizer. </li>
	<li> We also know that the centralizer is a subgroup. So we must have the identity and not just that but we must have the element itself since it commutes with itself. But the subgroup is closed so it must have any product</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, \(\text{Cent}(r) = \{e,r,r^2\}\). Similarly, \(\text{Cent}(j) = \{e,j\}\). What if we take another element that’s in the same orbit like \(rj\). We will see that \(\text{Cent}(rj) = \{e, rj\}\). 
<br />
<br />
In fact, all the dihedral odd groups will look similar to what we found above for \(D_3\). The even groups however are slightly different. \(D_4\) for example has an interesting element which is \(r^2\). It is interesting because it commutes with every other element in \(G\). Therefore, in \(D_4\), the center of the group is \(Z(D_4) = \{e, r^2\}\).  When \(n\) is odd, \(Z(D)\) contains the identity only.

This function is from \(x \rightarrow X\). Because it is a function, then we can plug in a value \(x\) such that \(\phi(g)(x) \in X\). Moreover, $$ \begin{align*} \varphi(e)(x) &amp;= x \quad \text{ because $\varphi(e)$ is the identity function } \\ \varphi(g_1g_2)(x) &amp;= (\varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2))(x) \quad \text{because $\phi$ is a homomorphism} \\ &amp;= \varphi(g_1)\big(\varphi(g_2)(x)\big) \end{align*} $$ Additionally, these identities force \(\varphi(g^{-1}) = \varphi(g)^{-1}\) which means that \(\varphi(g)\) is a bijection.

What is this function? $$ \begin{align*} \varphi: Sym(x) \xrightarrow{\text{identity function}} Sym(x) \end{align*} $$ This just gives us \(\varphi(g)=g\). This is exactly what we use when we work with permutations. A permutation is a function from \(X\) to itself. So for \(g \in G\) and \(x \in X\), we apply it like \(g(x) = gx\). Example Suppose \(G = SO(3)\) which acts on \(X = \mathbf{R}^3\). The action rule is given by $$ \begin{align*} G \times X &amp;\rightarrow X \\ A,x &amp;\rightarrow Ax \end{align*} $$ We’re defining a homomorphism $$ \begin{align*} SO(3) &amp;\rightarrow Sym(\mathbf{R}^3) \\ \varphi(A)(x) &amp;= Ax \end{align*} $$ \(Sym(\mathbf{R}^3)\) is the group of all bijection maps from \(\mathbf{R}^3\) to itself. The map \(\varphi\) takes a matrix \(A \in SO(3)\) and produces the following function $$ \begin{align*} \varphi(A): \mathbf{R}^3 &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{R}^3 \\ x &amp;\rightarrow Ax \end{align*} $$ Orbits Next, we’ll define something called an orbit of action by \(G\) on \(X\). Orbit of Action by \(G\) on \(X\) An Orbit is a subset of \(X\) of the form $$ \begin{align*} O(x) = \{gx \ | \ g \in G\}, \quad \text{for some } x \in X \end{align*} $$ Fact: orbits are equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on \(X\). So \(x \sim y\) if and only if there is some \(g \in G\) such that \(gx = y\). So, \(O(x)O(y) = \emptyset\) or \(O(x) = O(y)\). Therefore, orbits partition \(X\) into pairwise disjoint and nonempty subsets. One more fact: We action is called transitive if there is only one orbit so \(O(x) = X\). Stabilizers One more defintion. Stabilizer For each \(x \in X\) $$ \begin{align*} \text{Stab}(x) = \text{Stab}_G(y) = \{g \in \ | \ gx = x\} \end{align*} $$ These are the set of elements of \(G\) that "fix" x. Some facts: \(\text{Stab}(x) \leq G\) If \(x, y \in X\) and these elements are related such that for some \(g \in G\), we have \(y = gx\), then \(\text{Stab}(y) = g\text{Stab}(x)g^{-1}\). So if \(x\) and \(y\) are in the same orbit, then their stabilizer subgroups are conjugate. Kernel of Action What is the kernel of a group action? By definition, the kernel contains all the elements in \(g\) such that \(\varphi(x)\) is the identity transformation $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\varphi) = \{g \in G \ | \ gx = x \quad \text{for all } x \in X\} \end{align*} $$ Of course this looks exactly like the definition of a stabilizer that we just did. So, $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\varphi) = \bigcap_{x \in X} \text{Stab}(x) \unlhd G \end{align*} $$ We say that the action is faithful if \(\ker(\varphi) = \{e\}\). This is is the same as saying the homomorphism \(G \rightarrow Sym(x)\) is injective. Example 1 Suppose \(G = D_n\) which acts on \(X = \{v_0,v_1,...,v_{n-1}\}\). The action rule is given by the homomorphism $$ \begin{align*} \phi: D_n &amp;\rightarrow Sym(X) = S_n \end{align*} $$ For example. Suppose \(G = D_3 = \{e, r, r^2, j, rj, r^2j\}\) with \(V = \{v_0, v_1, v_2\}\). Given this setup. What are the orbits of the action? Pick one vertex like \(v_0\). What is the orbit of \(v_0\)? If we start with \(v_0\), then we can reach every other vertex so $$ \begin{align*} rv_0 &amp;= v_1 \\ rv_1 &amp;= r^2v_0 = v_2 \end{align*} $$ So the orbit of \(v_0\) is \(O(v_0) = \{v_0, v_1, v_2\}\). So there is only one orbit and in this case the action is transitive. What about the stabilizers? these are the set of elements of \(G\) that fix \(x\). For example, if we take \(v_0\), then we know that \(e\) fixes \(x\) so it’s in the set. Is there any other element such that if we hit \(x\) with it, we get \(x\) back? Notice that \(j\) does that since \(v_0\) is on the flip axis. We can do the same calculation for \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) to see that $$ \begin{align*} \text{Stab}(v_0) &amp;= \{e,j\} \\ \text{Stab}(v_1) &amp;= \{e,r^2j\} \\ \text{Stab}(v_2) &amp;= \{e, rj\} \end{align*} $$ Example 2 Let’s take another example. Suppose that \(G = SO(3)\) and \(X = \mathbf{R}^3\). Take the action given by the homomorphism $$ \begin{align*} SO(3) &amp;\rightarrow Sym(\mathbf{R}^3) \\ A,x &amp;= Ax \end{align*} $$ What is the orbit of \(v\)? Take a unit vector and compute its orbit under the action of \(SO(3)\). We elements do we get when we rotate this vector by any rotation in \(SO(3)\)? What vector do we get? We get another unit vector. In fact, given a vector with norm \(\lVert R \rVert = R\), we will get $$ \begin{align*} O(v) = \{x \in \mathbf{R}^3 \ | \ \lVert x \rVert = R \} \end{align*} $$ We get the set of vectors in \(\mathbf{R}^3\) with length \(R\). So a sphere of radius \(R\) centered at the origin. (Except for the zero vector where its orbit is 0 so \(O(0) = \{0\}\)). What about the stabilizers? If \(v\) is the zero vector, that’s easy because it’s all of \(SO(3)\). Any matrix \(A\) satisfies \(A0 = 0\). But for non-zero vectors, its the rotations of any angle around an axis through \(v\). $$ \begin{align*} \text{Stab}(0) &amp;= SO(3) \\ \text{Stab}(v) &amp;= \{Rot_u(O), O \in \mathbf{R}\}, \quad u = v/\lVert v \rVert \end{align*} $$ Is this a faithful? Is there any matrix \(A\) that fixes every vector \(v\) besides \(I\)? No, in fact, the kernel has only the identity matrix. Orbit Stabilizer Theorem Orbit Stabilizer Theorem Let \(G\) be a group that acts on \(X\). If \(x \in X\), then there is a bijection $$ \begin{align*} G/H &amp;\rightarrow O(x), \quad \text{where } H = \text{Stab}(x) \\ \end{align*} $$ \(G/H\) is the set \(\{gH\}\) of left \(H\)-cosets. A consequence of this theorem is a formula for the size of the orbit $$ \begin{align*} |O(x)| = [G: \text{Stab}(x)] \end{align*} $$ This is useful when the group is finite. So when it’s finite, then \(|O(x)| = \frac{|G|}{\text{Stab}(x)}|\). So the size of any orbit has to divide the order of the group. Proof We need to give a bijection. Consider the formula that takes a left coset \(gH\) to what you get when you apply the action on \(x\). $$ \begin{align*} \alpha: G/H &amp;\rightarrow O(x) \\ \alpha(gH) &amp;= gx \end{align*} $$ Step 1 involves showing that this is well defined. So given that \(gH = g'H\), then \(gx = g'x\). The reason why they would be equal is that \(H\) is simply the stabilizer \(\text{Stab}(x)\). Step 2 is showing that this is indeed a bijection. Actions by \(G\) on \(X = G\) Suppose you have a group \(G\). What will happen if it acts on its own set. So $$ \begin{align*} \varphi: G &amp;\rightarrow Sym(G) \end{align*} $$ There several of these. For example, we have the Left Regular Action. This is given by the homomorphism $$ \begin{align*} \lambda: G &amp;\rightarrow Sym(G) \\ \lambda(g)(x) &amp;= gx, \quad g,x \in G \end{align*} $$ What are the orbits of this action? For example, the orbit of \(e\) is everything $$ \begin{align*} O(e) = \{\lambda(g)(e), g \in G\} = \{ge, g \in G\} = G = X \end{align*} $$ What about the stabilizers? $$ \begin{align*} \text{Stab}(x) = \{g \in G \ | \ gx = x \} = \{e\} \end{align*} $$ A consequence of this is that the kernel of the action is, \(\ker(\lambda) = \{e\}\). Therefore, we have a faithful action. This actually led to the next big theorem which is Cayley’s Theorem Cayley's Theorem Every finite group \(G\) is isomorphic to a subgroup of some symmetric group \(S_m\) Proof Use the left regular action \(\lambda: G \rightarrow Sym(G) \cong S_n\). This is a faithful action which means that this action is injective. Therefore, \(G\) is isomorphic to the image subgroup which is \(Sym_n\) Right Regular and Conjugate Actions We also have a Right Regular Action (though we won’t use it) $$ \begin{align*} \rho: G &amp;\rightarrow Sym(G) \\ \rho(g)(x) &amp;= xg^{-1}, \quad g,x \in G \end{align*} $$ And the Conjugate Action $$ \begin{align*} c: G &amp;\rightarrow Sym(G) \\ c(g)(x) &amp;= gxg^{-1} \end{align*} $$ This is an action \(c(g_1) \circ c(g_2) = c(g_1g_2)\). The orbits of the conjugation action are called conjugacy classes. For example, if we have \(x \in X \in G\), then the conjugacy class of \(x\) is. It is a subset of the group \(G\) $$ \begin{align*} Cl(x) = \{gxg^{-1} \ | \ g \in G\}. \end{align*} $$ For the stabilizers, if we have \(x \in X = G\), then $$ \begin{align*} \text{Cent}(x) &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gxg^{-1} = x \} \\ &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gx = xg \} \end{align*} $$ The kernel $$ \begin{align*} Ker(c) = Z(G) &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gx = xg \ \forall x \in G \} \\ &amp;= \bigcap_{x \in G} \text{Cent}(x) \end{align*} $$ We actually do a relavent Theorem here Orbits/Stabilizers When \(G\) is finite, then \(|Cl(x)| = \frac{|G|}{|\text{Cent}(x)|}\) Example Suppose \(G = D_3 = \{e, r, r^2, j, rj, r^2j\}\). We want to compute the orbits which are now the conjugacy classes for each element. For example, the orbit/conjugacy class of the identity is just the identity, since conjugating the identity by any element in \(g\) gives us the identity back. $$ \begin{align*} geg^{-1} &amp;= e \quad \forall g \in G, \quad Cl(e) = \{e\} \end{align*} $$ For \(r\) we we can try conjugating by every element of \(g\) but we will see that we will always get \(r\) and \(r^2\) back. $$ \begin{align*} rrr^{-1} &amp;= r \\ jrj^{-1} &amp;= r^{-1} = r^2 \end{align*} $$ Therefore, \(Cl(r) = \{r, r^2\}\). Finally, let’s find the conjugacy class of \(j\) $$ \begin{align*} rjr^{-1} &amp;= rrj = r^2j \\ jjj &amp;= j \\ rjj(rj)^{-1} &amp;= rjr^{-1} = rrj = r^2j \\ ... \end{align*} $$ We’ll get \(Cl(j) = \{j, rj, r^2j\}\). Now, we can do the stabilizers. The stabilizer of \(e\) is any element that \(e\) fixes so it’s all of \(G\). What about \(r\)? By the previous theorem, \(|Cl(x)| = \frac{|G|}{|\text{Cent}(x)|}\). Since \(|Cl(r)|=2\), then we must have three elements in the centralizer. We also know that the centralizer is a subgroup. So we must have the identity and not just that but we must have the element itself since it commutes with itself. But the subgroup is closed so it must have any product Therefore, \(\text{Cent}(r) = \{e,r,r^2\}\). Similarly, \(\text{Cent}(j) = \{e,j\}\). What if we take another element that’s in the same orbit like \(rj\). We will see that \(\text{Cent}(rj) = \{e, rj\}\). In fact, all the dihedral odd groups will look similar to what we found above for \(D_3\). The even groups however are slightly different. \(D_4\) for example has an interesting element which is \(r^2\). It is interesting because it commutes with every other element in \(G\). Therefore, in \(D_4\), the center of the group is \(Z(D_4) = \{e, r^2\}\). When \(n\) is odd, \(Z(D)\) contains the identity only.

<h4><b>Symmetry Groups</b></h4>
<p>The reason we introduced these regular polyhedra is because we want to study their symmetry groups. So now, given a Polyhedron, we have a set \(V\) of vertices (with the center of mass at 0). Define, the symmetry group \(G\) of the polyhedron as</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	G = \{ A \in SO(3) \ | \ v \in V \Leftrightarrow Av \in V, v \in \mathbf{R}^3 \}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So this a point is a vertex if and only if, rotating this point by \(A\) is also a vertex. It should be clear that \(G\) is a subgroup of \(SO(3)\). For example, how many rotational symmetries does the cube have? It is twice the number of edges for all of them. In fact, the symmetry group of the octahedron and the cube are isomorphic to each other because the two solids are duel of each other. Similarly, the symmetry group of dodecahedron is isomorphic to the symmetry group of the icosahedron. 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>The Symmetry Group of the Tetrahedron</b></h4>
<p>Let’s study the specific symmetry group of the Tetrahedron. Notice that if we draw a line from any vertex through the centroid of the opposite face, we get an axis where we can rotate around. We have two possible rotations here. Going one third clockwise and one third of full rotation counter clockwise. So \(2\pi / 3\) in either direction. Each of these have order 3. Moreover, there are 4 possible axes of this type since we have 4 different vertices.
<br />
<br />
The next possible rotational symmetry is the one that goes through a mid point of an edge to another midpoint of another edge. It’s a 180 degrees symmetry. So its order is 2 and we have 3 such possible axes.</p>

<p>So we have exactly 12 symmetries of the tetrahedron. This group is isomorphic to \(A_4\). The group of even permutations inside \(S_4\). How does this happen? Consider the set of vertices \(\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}\) of a tetrahedron. Now, any symmetry permutes the vertices. Since we have 4 vertices, then \(Sym(4) \cong S_4\). We can construct a homomorphism such that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: G \rightarrow Sym(V) \cong S_4 \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The kernel of this homomorphism is just the identity symmetry. If you think about it, what symmetry corresponds to the identity permutation? it’s just the identity symmetry so the kernel is the trivial kernel. How do we find the actual permutations that get mapped to the symmetries in the above table. Well, the first kind where the axis is from a vertex to the centroid of a face is equivalent to a permutation that leaves one vertex fixed. Thus, we get all the 3-cycle type permutations. For the other edge to edge axis kind of symmetry, notice here that each pair of vertices switch, therefore, we have to include the 2+2 cycle type permutations. Therefore, the the permutations we have are the 2+2 and the 3-cycle permutations. There are 12 of those and in fact, this is the subgroup \(A_4\). Since the kernel of \(\phi\) is the trivial subgroup, then \(G \cong A_4\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>The Symmetry Group of the Cube</b></h4>
<p>Next, we want to explore the symmetries of the cube. The first symmetry that we can construct is the symmetry around the axis that goes between two opposite vertices. We have 8 vertices total. Therefore, there are 4 pairs of those vertices. So 4 axes total. A rotation is one third of a full spin, so the angle is \(2\pi/3\). Since we have two choices for the angle, then the number of total rotations is \(2*4 = 8\) total rotations.
<br />
<br />
The next symmetry is the symmetry around the axis connecting the midpoints of two opposite edges. We have 12 edges. So we have 6 pairs of opposite edges. The angle is exactly 180 degrees. So we have exactly 6 symmetries
<br />
<br />
The next symmetry is the symmetry around the axis connecting the centroid of two faces. We can rotate by a 90 degrees either clockwise or counter clockwise. There are 6 faces so 3 opposite pairs of faces. There are 2 rotations for each pair so a total of 6 symmetries. But we can also rotate by 180 degrees. So therefore we have another 3 rotations here.</p>
<div>
<table style="margin: 20px auto;">
  <tr>
    <td>Axis (Cube)</td>
	<td># of Axes</td>
    <td>Angle of Rotation</td>
	<td>Order of Symmetry</td>
	<td># of Symmetries of This Type</td>
    <td>Axis (Octahedron)</td>
	<td>Cycle Type</td>

</div>
<p>So we have exactly 24 symmetries just like we expected (twice the number of edges). What group is this isomorphic to? It turns out to be isomorphic to \(S_4\). Previously we have 4 vertices so it was easy to see or construct the homomorphism. But now we have 8 vertices so it’s not exactly clear. We want to construct a homomorphism from \(G\) to \(S_4\). So we need to find function from \(G\) to \(Sym(\text{4 things in a cube})\). What will the 4 things be? The easiest choice is the diagonals. We have 4 different diagonals between every pair of opposite vertices. The symmetry of the cube permutes the 4 diagonals.
<br />
<br />
So next we want \(\phi\) to not just be a homomorphism. We want it to be an isomorphism. Each group has exactly 24 elements. So if we should that \(\phi\) is injective, then that suffies to conclude that it’s an isomorphism. In order to do that, we just need to figure out what each of these symmetries do. So</p>
<ul>
	<li>Vertex/Vertex Symmetry: Notice here that the diagonal between the axis we're rotating around is fixed. While the other three diagonals get permuted. The other three diagonals get permuted cyclicly. So this is 3-cycle permutation.</li>
	<!-------------------------------->
	<li>Edge/Edge Symmetry: Here the axis is from an edge midpoint to another edge point. When we rotate around this axis by 180 degrees, notice here that two of the diagonals stay fixed. The ones in the xy plane. The remaining diagonals get switched. So this is a two cycle. </li>
	<!-------------------------------->
	<li>Face/Face Symmetry (Quarter Turn): When we do a quarter turn here, all the diagonals get switched cyclicly so this is  a 4-cycle. </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>The Symmetry Group of the Dodecahedron</b></h4>
<p>Next, we’ll do the symmetry group of the Dodecahedron</p>
<ul>
	<li>Vertex/Vertex Symmetry: We have a total of 20 vertices. So 20 pairs of axes. Each vertex is connected to three edges. So each turn is a third of a full turn like before. Since it's 3 turns total, then each symmetry is of order 3. The number of symmetries is then 10*2 for each angle, so 20 total symmetries. </li>
	<!-------------------------------->
	<li>Edge/Edge Symmetry: Here the axis is from an edge midpoint to another edge point. Since an edge needs to go to another edge, the only angle here is 180 degrees. So the order is 2. There are 30 edges so we have 15 pairs. </li>
	<!-------------------------------->
	<li>Face/Face Symmetry: We have 12 faces total. When we rotate around an axis connecting two faces, then there are 4 possible turns. So the angle is \(\pm \frac{2\pi}{3}\). Therefore, the order is 5.</li>

</div>
<p>So there are 60 total symmetries matching the rule (edges * 2). Note here that all the cycles are even cycles. In fact, \(G\) is isomorphic to \(A_5\). To show this we need to construct a homomorphism to a permutation group of a set of 5 things in the dodecahedron such that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	G \rightarrow Sym(\text{5 things in the dodecahedron}) \cong S_5
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Take the 30 edges and divide them into groups of 6 edges each. Each edge has 5 other friends. One friend is the opposite edge that’s parallel to it. And there are 4 other perpendicular edges to it. So everything in group of 6 is either parallel or perpendicular. 
<br />
<br />
The image of this homomorphism is exactly \(A_5\) and this homomorphism is also injective. From these two facts, we can conclude that \(G \rightarrow A_5\). To show this, we simply determine the cycle type like we did before in the above table (last column). This is really hard to visualize actually. But you want to see what happens to the group of edge friends when we rotate around each of the axes in the above table. For example, for the face to face axis, all the friends get cyclically rotated. So it’s a 5-cycle.

A group \(G\) is finitely generated if \(G = \langle S \rangle\) where \(S\) is a finite subset of \(G\), \(S \subseteq G\)

<li>For example, every cyclic is finitely generated by this definition (by a subset of one element). An example is \(\mathbf{Z}\). It is infinite but it is finitely generated by an element.</li>

If \(G\) is finitely generated and abelian, then

	\begin{align*}
	G \cong \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_1} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_2} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_k}

<p>For finite abelian groups, we won’t have terms like \(\mathbf{Z}\) since they are finite. So we will get exactly the invariant factor form out of this. So this proposition will essentially give us the existence of invariant factor decomposition. It will take this lecture and probably the next lecture to prove it.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>The Existence of Invariant Factor Decomposition Proof Sketch</b></h4>
<p>So now we want to describe the steps involved in this proof:</p>

<ol>
	<!-------------------STEP 1--------------------->
	<li> If \(G\) is finitely generated and abelian, then we will see that
		<div>
			$$
			\begin{align*}
			G &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}^m/N \text{ where } \mathbf{Z}^m = \mathbf{Z} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}
			\end{align*}
			$$
		</div>
		In fact, what we will really show is that there exists a surjective homomorphism such that
		<div>
			$$
			\begin{align*}
			\phi: \mathbf{Z}^m \rightarrow G
			\end{align*}
			$$
		</div>
		So now since we have a surjective homomorphism, we can then use the isomorphism theorem to conclude that 
		<div>
			$$
			\begin{align*}
			G \cong \mathbf{Z}^m / (N = ker(\phi))
			\end{align*}
			$$
		</div>
	</li>
	<!-------------------STEP 2--------------------->
	<li>What is \(N\) going to be? To answer this, we want to study the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}^m\). We will show that every subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}^m\) is finitely generated (won't be easy) and abelian. As a consequence, we will get that there exists a surjective homomorphism such that
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		\mathbf{Z}^n \xrightarrow{\rho} N \xrightarrow{i} \mathbf{Z}^m
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
	From this we can form the composite homomorphism \(\alpha = i \circ \rho\) between \(\mathbf{Z}^n\) and \(\mathbf{Z}^m\).<br />
	Notice above that the subgroup \(N\) must be the image of \(\alpha\) so \(N = \alpha(\mathbf{Z}^n)\). So, now we can re-write what we have to be
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		 G \cong \mathbf{Z}^m / \alpha(\mathbf{Z}^n)
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
	For some homomorphism \(\alpha: \mathbf{Z}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}^m\). We still don't know what \(\alpha\) is but now the question of understanding finitely generated abelian can be reduced to a question of understanding homomorphisms.
	</li>
	<!-------------------STEP 3--------------------->
	<li>Every homomorphism \(\alpha: \mathbf{Z}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}^m\) is of the form
		<div>
			$$
			\begin{align*}
			 L_A: \ &amp;\mathbf{Z}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}^m \\
			      &amp;L_A(x) = Ax
			\end{align*}
			$$
		</div>
	where \(A \in \text{Mat}_{m \times n}(\mathbf{Z})\) and \(x = [x_1 \ x_2 \ ... \ x_n]^T \in \mathbf{Z}_n, x_i \in \mathbf{Z} \).
	<br />
	So any homomorphism from \(\mathbf{Z}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}^m\) can be written as a left multiplication by a matrix \(A\). So now we can write
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		 G \cong \mathbf{Z}^m / L_A(\mathbf{Z}^n)
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
	So we're reducing the problem to linear algebra over the integers.
	</li>
	<!-------------------STEP 4--------------------->
	<li>Say \(P \in \text{Mat}_{n \times n}(\mathbf{Z})\) is integer invertible if \(P^{-1}\) exists and \(P^{-1} \in Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbf{Z}) \).<br /> Then,
			
	if \(B = PAQ\), where \(P, Q\) are integer invertible, then
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		 G \cong \mathbf{Z}^m / L_A(\mathbf{Z}^n) \cong \mathbf{Z}^m / L_B(\mathbf{Z}^n)
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
	The goal is that if we didn't want \(A\) or \(A\) wasn't in the right form, we can put it in standard form (smith normal form) and use a matrix that we want.
	</li>
	<!-------------------STEP 5--------------------->
	<li>A matrix \(D \in \text{Mat}_{m \times n}(\mathbf{Z})\) is a Smith normal form if
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		D = 
		\begin{pmatrix}
		d_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
		0 &amp; d_2 &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; 0 \\
		0 &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; 0 \\
		0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; d_s &amp; 0 \\
		\end{pmatrix}
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
	where \(d_i \geq 0\) and \(d_i \ | \ d_{i+1}\). Since, it doesn't need to be a square matrix, then the last column(s) might just be zero. <br />
	If we have this, then the claim is that
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		\mathbf{Z}^m / L_D(\mathbf{Z}^n) \cong \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_1} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_2} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_s} \times \mathbf{Z}^{m-s}  
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
	</li>
	<!-------------------STEP 6--------------------->
	<li>For every \(A \in \text{Mat}_{n \times n}(\mathbf{Z})\) there exists a integer invertible \(P, Q\), such that
	\(D = PAQ\) is a Smith normal form. This implies that
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		 G \cong \mathbf{Z}^m / L_A(\mathbf{Z}^n) \cong \mathbf{Z}^m / L_D(\mathbf{Z}^n)
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So what we did here is that we turned the problem into a problem about quotients by the image of a homomorphism that looked liked a left multiplication by a matrix. And then we took this matrix and put it in a Smith normal form. This leads to the form we want.
<br />

<h4><b>Proof Setup: Definitions</b></h4>
<p>Before starting with the proof, we need some setup, starting with this definition.
<br /></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
If \(G\) is an abelian group with addition. A subset \(S \subseteq G\) is linearly independent if \(\forall \ a_1,...,a_n \in S\) and \(\forall \ c_1,...,c_n \in \mathbf{Z}\), If

		\begin{align*}
		 c_1a_1 + ... + c_na_n = 0
		\end{align*}
		$$
then, \(c_1 = ... =c_n = 0\).
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
In Vector Spaces, the \(c_i\)s are scalars.
<br />
<br />
Example: Suppose \(S \subseteq G\) and \(S = \{a\}\). What does it mean for \(S\) to be linearly independent? <br />
From the definition, \(S\) is linearly indenpendent if</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\forall c \in \mathbf{Z}, \quad ca = 0
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Then this implies that \(c = 0\). So no matter what \(c\) is if \(ca = 0\) only implies that \(c = 0\). So \(a\) must have infinite order (\(o(a) = \infty\)). This isn’t the same for subsets with more than 1 element. <br />
We also have the notion of a basis

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Example 1: \(\{1\}\) is a basis for \(\mathbf{Z}\)
<br />
<br />
Example 2: \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) has no basis. Why? we can’t have non-empty linear independent. Because if we have a non-empty subset with only element, this element will have infinite order.
<br />
<br />
So unlike Vector Space, not every abelian group will have a basis

<h4><b>Subgroups of Finitely Generated Groups</b></h4>
<p>[Lecture 24]. So given a finitely generated group \(G = \langle a_1,...,a_n \rangle\). We want to know is this property of being finitely generated inherited? Do subgroups and quotient groups of \(G\) are also finitely generated? If we have a normal subgroup \(N\). Is \(G/N\) finitely generated? The answer is actually yes. In fact, can write \(G/N = \langle a_1N,...a_nN \rangle\). So quotients of finitely generated groups are finitely generated as well. 
<br />
<br />
One thing to note here is that one of these elements will turn out to be the identity element and since it’s the identity, then we don’t need to keep it in the generators list. So \(G/N = \langle a_1N_1,...a_{n-1}N \rangle\). We can throw one of the elements out. (explain more?)
<br />
<br />
A related question to this. If we have a subgroup \(H \leq G\) where \(G\) is finitely generated. Is \(H\) finitely generated? The answer is actually no. It doesn’t need to be. In fact, only if \(G\) is finitely generated and abelian, then every subgroup \(H \leq G\) is also finitely generated. We will prove this but to do so, we’ll prove the following required lemma first.
<br />
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Lemma
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(H\) be an (abelian) group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup of \(H\) (\(N\) is always normal since \(H\) is abelian). If \(N\) and \(H/N\) are finitely generated, then \(H\) is finitely generated. 
</div>
<p><br />
Note here that this lemma in fact works for all groups with a normal subgroup and not just abelian groups but right now we only care about the abelian case and it will also make the proof easier.
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Suppose \(N\) is a normal subgroup of \(H\) and suppose that both \(N\) and \(H/N\) are finitely generated. Then, we can write</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	N &amp;= \mathbf{Z}\{x_1,...,x_m\} \\
	H/N &amp;= \mathbf{Z}\{\bar{y_1},...,\bar{y_n}\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Now, for each \(\bar{y_i}\), pick \(y_i \in H\) such that \(\bar{y_i} = y_i + N\). So \(y_i\) is the representative for this coset. Another way to think about this is to remember that we have the quotient homomorphism \(\pi\) where</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\pi: H &amp;\longrightarrow H/N \\
	     \pi(y_i) &amp;= \bar{y_i}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Given this, we claim that \(H\) is generated by \(\mathbf{Z}\{x_1,...,x_m,y_1,...,y_n\}\). So we’re combining the elements of \(N\) and all the representatives of the cosets. This gives us a generating set for \(H\) itself. To see why it’s true. Suppose that \(u \in H\). The goal is to write \(u\) in terms of the elements in our claim. Consider the image of \(u\) under \(\pi\). Its image is in the quotient group \(H/N\) so we can write</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	v = \pi(u) = b_1\bar{y_1} + ... + b_n\bar{y_n} \in H/N \quad \text{ for some } b_i \in \mathbf{Z}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We can do this because the set \(\{\bar{y_1},...,\bar{y_n}\}\) generates \(H/N\). So we can write \(v\) as a linear combination of the elements in the set like we did. Now define \(\hat{v}\) to be an element in \(H\). We can also write it</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\hat{v} = b_1y_1 + ... + b_ny_n \in H
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We can do this because each \(y_i\) is in \(H\) and \(H\) is closed so \(\hat{v}\) is in \(H\). 
Observe that \(\pi(\hat{v}) = v\) because we defined earlier that \(\pi(y_i) = \bar{y_i}\). So now we have</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\pi(u) &amp;= v = \pi(\hat{v})
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now calculate \(\pi(u - \hat{v})\), we will see that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\pi(u - \hat{v}) &amp;= v - v = 0
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This means that \(u - \hat{v}\) is in the kernel of \(\pi\) which means that \(u - \hat{v} \in N\). But \(N\) is finitely generated so we can express \(u - \hat{v}\) in terms of the elements in \(N\) so</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	u - \hat{v} = a_1x_1 + ... + a_nx_n \in N \text{ where } a_i \in \mathbf{Z} \\
	u = (a_1x_1 + ... + a_nx_n) + (b_1y_1 + ... + b_ny_n)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So this says that any element in \(H\) can be written interms of those factors which means that \(H\) is finitely generated. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
Now we’re ready to prove the main theorem
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
If \(G\) is finitely generated and abelian, then every subgroup \(H \leq G\) is also finitely generated.
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\{a_1,...,a_n\}\) and \(H \leq G\). We want to show that \(H\) is finitely generated. We will show this by  induction on the size of generating set.
<br />
<br />
Base Case: <br />
If \(n = 0\), then \(G = \mathbf{Z}\{\} = \{e\}\). So \(G\) is the trivial group. <br />
If \(n = 1\), then, \(G = \mathbf{Z}\{a\}\). So \(G\) is cyclic. Any subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic. 
<br />
<br />
Inductive Case: \((n \geq 2)\). Let \(a_n = a\) in the generators list just to make it easy to read.<br />
First, since \(G\) is abelian, then all of \(G\)’s subgroups are normal. Consider the subgroup generated by the last element in the list of generators in \(G\). So \(\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\). This subgroup is normal. Now, consider the intersection of \(H\) and \(\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\). This is also a subgroup of both \(\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\) and \(H\) by the Diamond Isomorphism Theorem. In fact, we will get the following diagram.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec24/1.png" width="35%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Now, let the intersection \(H \cap \mathbf{Z}\{a\}\) be \(N\). We will take the quotient group \(H/N\). Similarly, we have another quotient group \(H + \mathbf{Z}\{a\}/\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\). These two quotient groups are isomorphic by the Diamond Isomorphism Theorem.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec24/2.png" width="65%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Next, take the quotient group \(G/\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\). Notice here that \(H + \mathbf{Z}\) is a subgroup of \(G\) and that we’re taking the quotient by the same subgroup \(\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\). Therefore, by the correspondance theorem, we will see that \(H + \mathbf{Z}\{a\}/\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\) is a subgroup of \(G/\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec24/3.png" width="72%" class="center" /></p>

<p>So now, observe that \(G\) is generated by \(n\) elements. The group \(G/\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\) is generated by \(n-1\) elements. Why? Recall that we said earlier that since the subgroup has one element \(a\) from the generators, then this element will be come the identity element in the quotient group and we don’t need to include it in the list of generators for the quotient group.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec24/4.png" width="72%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Also note, that \(\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\) is a subgroup generated by one element so it’s cyclic and so it’s finitely generated. Since the intersection \(N = \mathbf{Z}\{a\}\) is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\), then it’s also cyclic and finitely generated.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec24/5.png" width="77%" class="center" /></p>

<p>We can now use the induction hypothesis to say that since \(G/\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\) is generated by \(n-1\) elements, then all its subgroups are also finitely generated. So \(H + \mathbf{Z}\{a\}/\mathbf{Z}\{a\}\) is finitely generated. But this group is isomorphic to \(H/H \cap \mathbf{Z}\{a\} = H/N\). So \(H/N\) is also finitely generated.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec24/6.png" width="77%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Finally, we can use the lemma to say that since \(H/N\) is finitely generated and since \(N\) is finitely generated, then \(H\) is finitely generated as we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Consequences</b></h4>
<p>So now, recall the proposition we introduced where if \(G\) is finitely generated and abelian then there exists a surjective homomorphism \(\phi: \mathbf{Z}^n \rightarrow G\). So by the isomorphism theorem, \(G\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}^m/N\) where \(N\) is the kernel of \(\phi\) (normal subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}^m)\). 
<br />
<br />
But we just proved above that the subgroup \(N\) must also be finitely generated since \(\mathbf{Z}^m\) is finitely generated and abelian. So there exists, some \(n \geq 0\) such that \(\bar{\alpha}: \mathbf{Z}^n \rightarrow N\) is a surjective homomorphism. (why?)
<br />
<br />
So now consider the following</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\mathbf{Z}^n \xrightarrow{\bar{\alpha}} N \xrightarrow{i} \mathbf{Z}^m 
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Consider \(\alpha: i \circ \bar{\alpha}\). We know that \(\alpha(\mathbf{Z}^n) = N\). \(\alpha\) is a homomorphism since it’s the composition \(i \circ \bar{\alpha}\). Therefore, the isomorphism \(G \cong \mathbf{Z}^m/N\) can be written as \(G \cong \mathbf{Z}^m/\alpha(\mathbf{Z}^n)\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Studying the Homomorphism from \(\mathbf{Z^n}\) to \(\mathbf{Z^m}\)</b></h4>
<p>So now the goal is to show that \(\alpha: \mathbf{Z}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}^m\) can be represented with a left multiplication by a matrix \(L_A\). Observe that if we take any matrix \(A \in \text{Mat}_{m \times n}(\mathbf{Z})\), we can define the following</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	L_A: \mathbf{Z}^n &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}^m \\
	       L_A(c_1,...,c_n) &amp;= (\sum_{j=1}^n a_{1j}c_j, \sum_{j=1}^n a_{2j}c_j, ..., \sum_{j=1}^n a_{mj}c_j) \\
		   L_A\big(\begin{pmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \vdots \\ c_n \end{pmatrix}\big)
		   &amp;=
		   A
		   \begin{pmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \vdots \\ c_n \end{pmatrix}
		   \in
		   \begin{pmatrix}d_1 \\ d_2 \\ \vdots \\ d_n \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbf{Z}^m
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We claim that \(L_A\) is a homomorphism. (We won’t prove this). Basically, any homomorphism can be represented with a matrix. To find the matrix, all we need is to plug in the standard basis vectors into \(\alpha\) to get the matrix \(A\) (column vectors).
<br />
<br />
Moreover, \(\alpha: \mathbf{Z}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}^m\) is equal to \(L_A\) for a unique \(A \in \text{Mat}_{m \times n}(\mathbf{Z})\). Furthermore, if \(A \in \text{Mat}_{m \times n}(\mathbf{Z})\) and \(B \in \text{Mat}_{m \times p}(\mathbf{Z})\), then \(L_{AB} = L_A \circ L_B\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>The Homomorphism \(\alpha\)</b></h4>
<p>Suppose now that \(L_A: \mathbf{Z}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}^m\) is an isomorphism. Then \((L_A)^{-1}\) is also an isomorphism. If we let \(L_B = (L_A)^{-1}\), then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	L_{BA} &amp;= L_B \circ L_A = id_{\mathbf{Z}^n} \\
	L_{AB} &amp;= L_A \circ L_B = id_{\mathbf{Z}^m}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So \(AB = I\) and \(BA = I\). So by linear algebra (over the linear algebra), \(m = n\). Therefore, we can’t really have an isomorphism unless \(m = n\).
<br />
<br /></p>

<h4><b>Smith Normal Form</b></h4>
<p>A matrix \(A\) is in Smith normal form if</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	A = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
	d_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
	0 &amp; d_2 &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; 0 \\

Let \(\phi\) be defined as</p>

	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(\phi\) is surjective and \(\ker(\phi) = L_A(\mathbf{Z}^n)\). This is because all the entries \(x_{s+1}...x_m\) must be zero and the earlier entries must be divisible by \(d_i\).

Today, we want to prove the existence of the elementary divisor decomposition. To do this, we will show instead the existence of the invariant factor decomposition. But when we show this, it turns out that it implies something for a larger class than just finite abelian groups. It’s going to imply this any finitely generated abelian groups. Definition A group \(G\) is finitely generated if \(G = \langle S \rangle\) where \(S\) is a finite subset of \(G\), \(S \subseteq G\) Examples: For example, every cyclic is finitely generated by this definition (by a subset of one element). An example is \(\mathbf{Z}\). It is infinite but it is finitely generated by an element. Every finite group \(G\) is finitely generated. \(G = \langle G \rangle\). \(D_{\infty} = \langle r, j \rangle\) \((\mathbf{Q},+)\), the group of rational numbers with addition is not finitely generated. We also have the following fact Proposition If \(G \cong H\), \(G\) is finitely generated if and only if \(H\) is finitely generated. So being finitely generated is isomorphism invariant. What we want to prove is the following Proposition If \(G\) is finitely generated and abelian, then $$ \begin{align*} G \cong \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_1} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_2} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{d_k} \end{align*} $$ For some \(d_1,...,d_k \geq 0, k \geq 0, d_i \ | \ d_{i+1}\) Example: Suppose \(G\) has \(d_i = 1,3,12,12,720,0,0\) Then $$ \begin{align*} G &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{1} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{3} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{12} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{12} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{720} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{0} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{0} \\ &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{3} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{12} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{12} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{720} \times \mathbf{Z} \times \mathbf{Z} \\ &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{3} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{12} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{12} \times \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}_{720} \times \mathbf{Z}^2 \end{align*} $$ For finite abelian groups, we won’t have terms like \(\mathbf{Z}\) since they are finite. So we will get exactly the invariant factor form out of this. So this proposition will essentially give us the existence of invariant factor decomposition. It will take this lecture and probably the next lecture to prove it.

The following are just notes so I can fully follow along.
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Inner Semidirect Product Group</b></h4>
<p>Suppose we’re given two subgroups \(H, K \leq G\). We also know that \(HK = G\) and \(H \cap K = \{e\}\) (in this case, we call \(H\) and \(K\) complements). Consider the map</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: H \times K &amp;\rightarrow G \\
	              (h,k)  &amp;\rightarrow hk
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We want to show that \(\phi\) is a bijection. To do this, we’ll first show that \(\phi\) is injective. So given the elements \(h_1, h_2 \in H\) and \(k_1, k_2 \in K\) such that \(\phi(h_1,k_1) = \phi(h_2,k_2)\), we want to show that \((h_1,k_1) = (h_2,k_2)\). Observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(h_1,k_1) &amp;= \phi(h_2,k_2) \\
	h_1k_1 &amp;= h_2k_2 \\
	(h_2)^{-1}h_1k_1 &amp;= k_2 \\
	(h_2)^{-1}h_1k_1k_1^{-1} &amp;= k_2k_1^{-1} \\
	(h_2)^{-1}h_1 &amp;= k_2k_1^{-1} \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Since \((h_2)^{-1}h_1 \in H\) and \(k_2k_1^{-1} \in K\) and \((h_2)^{-1}h_1 = k_2k_1^{-1}\), then this value must be in the intersection \(H \cap K\). But \(H \cap K = \{e\}\). Therefore, this must be the identity element and so</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(h_2)^{-1}h_1 &amp;= k_2k_1^{-1} = e
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>But this just means that \((h_2)^{-1}h_1 = e\) and so \(h_1 = h_2\) and similarly \(k_1 = k_2\). Therefore \((h_1,k_1) = (h_2,k_2)\). So \(\phi\) is injective.
<br />
<br />
Next, we want to show that \(\phi\) is surjective. Notice that \(Im(\phi) = \{hk \ | \ h \in H, k \in K\} = HK = G\). This just means that \(\phi\) is surjective since the codomain in \(G\). Therefore, \(\phi\) is a bijection. 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>How to Make \(\phi\) a Homomorphism</b></h4>
<p>Now, suppose that we’re also given that \(H\) is normal. We know that \(\phi: H \times G \rightarrow G\) is a bijection. We also know that \(G\) is a group but we never defined \(H \times K\) as a group. We just said it was a set. The question is can we make \(H \times K\) a group so that \(\phi\) isn’t just a bijection but also an isomorphism? (hmmm, this is a iff right?)
<br />
<br />
We already know \(\phi\) is a bijection so we only need to show that \(\phi\) is a homomorphism. To be a homomorphism we need to prove that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi((h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2)) = \phi((h_1,k_1))\phi((h_2,k_2))
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Notice that we have NOT defined what the product will look like but we know that the right hand side is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	h_1k_1h_2k_2
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The goal is to write this product as a product of an element in \(H\) multiplied by an element from \(K\). This is exactly why we wanted or need \(H\) to be normal. So insert \(k_1^{-1}k_1\) as follows</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	h_1k_1h_2k_2 &amp;= h_1k_1h_2 (k_1^{-1}k_1) k_2 \\
	             &amp;= (h_1)(k_1h_2k_1^{-1}) (k_1k_2) \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Note here that the first two elements are in \(H\). \(h_1 \in H\) and \(k_1h_2k_1^{-1} \in H\) since \(H\) is normal. So we have exactly what we want. Why do we care? we want this because now we can write this as \(\phi\) of some \((h,k) \in H \times K\) where \(h = (h_1)(k_1h_2k_1^{-1})\) and \(k = (k_1k_2)\). So</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi((h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2)) &amp;= \phi((h_1,k_1))\phi((h_2,k_2)) \\
	                         &amp;= h_1k_1h_2k_2 \\
							 &amp;= (h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}) (k_1k_2) \\
	                         &amp;= \phi((h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}), k_1k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>

<p>But remember that \(\phi\) is a bijection so it’s injective. So saying that \(\phi((h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2)) = \phi((h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}), k_1k_2)\) implies that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) = (h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}, k_1k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This immediately gives us the required operation for \(G \times H\) to be a group. If we define this product above to be how we multiply elements in \(H \times K\), then \(\phi\) is a homomorphism and therefore, it is an isomorphism from \(G \times H \rightarrow G\). Since we already use \(G \times H\) to denote the direct product group, we use the notation \(G \rtimes K\) to denote this semidirect product group (internal semi direct product).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Outer Semidirect Product Group</b></h4>
<p>So now consider the groups \(H\) and \(K\). \(H\) and \(K\) are just two groups. They are not necessarily subgroups of \(G\). We want to find \(G\) such that \(G\) satisfies the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>\(H_G\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\)</li>
	<li>\(K_G\) is a subgroup of \(G\)</li>
	<li>\(H_G \cap K = \{e\}\)</li>
	<li>\(H_GK_G = G\)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that \(H_G\) is a subgroup of \(G\) that is isomorphic to \(H\) so it might not be \(H\) but at least it’s isomorphic to \(H\). So our goal here is to take two groups and make a new group such that this new group \(G\) is isomorphic to their direct product \(H \times K\).
<br />
<br />
So how can we make a group that satisfies these conditions? It’s important to remember that we don’t know anything about \(H\) or \(K\) and they might not be related. So we can’t just multiply \(hk\). We need a way to treat the elements of \(H\) and the elements of \(K\) separately. One way to do this is to use ordered pairs. What we can do is define the set of elements \(H \times K\) to be</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 H \times K = \{(h, k) \ | \ h \in H, k \in K\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This way, they stay separate. Additionally, this makes it easier to find the subgroups that we need. For example, we can define</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 H_G = H \times \{e_k\} &amp;= \{(h,e_K) \ | \ h \in H \} \quad \text{with the group product}\\
	 (h_1, e_K)&amp;(h_2, e_K) = (h_1h_2, e_K)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>And similarly define \(K_G\) as</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 K_G = \{e_H\} \times K &amp;= \{(e_H, k) \ | \ h \in H \}  \quad \text{with the group product}\\
	 (e_H, k_1)&amp;(e_H, k_2) = (e_H, k_1k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Using this construction, we can see that \(H_G \cap K_G = \{(e_H,e_K)\}\). Next, we want to show that \(H_GK_G = G\). By construction, \(H_GK_G = \{(h,e)(e,k)\}\). We defined \(G = H \times K\). What we want is have \(H_GK_G = G = H \times K\). In other words, we want</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 H_GK_G &amp;= \{(h,e)(e,k)\} = \{(h,k)\} = H \times K = G \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>One way to do this is to define the group \(H \times K\)’s product to be</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(h,e)(e,k) = (h,k)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This works and gives us the condition \(H_GK_G = G\). But this defines the product for these edge cases. What about the product of arbitrary elements \((h_1,k_1), (h_2,k_2) \in G = H \times K\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) &amp;= (h_1, e)(e, k_1)(h_2, e)(e, k_2) \quad \text{(using the product we defined)} \\
	                    &amp;=(h_1, e)(e, k_1)(h_2,e)[(e,k_1^{-1})(e,k_1)](e, k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Remember that we want \(H\) to be normal. So we’ll use the same trick from the inner product group in the first section and insert \((e,k_1^{-1})(e,k_1)\) in the middle. This means that \((e, k_1)(h_2,e)(e,k_1^{-1}) \in H\)
<br />
<br />
Now recall that conjugation by a element in a group is an automorphism.</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	   \gamma: G &amp;\rightarrow Aut(G) \\
	   \gamma_g(x) &amp;\rightarrow gxg^{-1}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>What is \(\gamma_{gh}\)?</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	   \gamma_{gh}(x) &amp;= ghx(gh)^{-1}  \\
	                  &amp;= g(hxh^{-1})g^{-1} \\
					  &amp;= g(\gamma_{h}(x))g^{-1} \\
					  &amp;= \gamma_g(\gamma_h(x)) \\
					  &amp;= \gamma_g \circ \gamma_h(x)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So \(\gamma\) is a group homomorphism. So going back to the group \(H \times K\)</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) &amp;=(h_1, e)[(e, k_1)(h_2,e)(e,k_1^{-1})](e,k_1)(e, k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We know that \(H_G\) is normal so if we conjugate any element in \(H_G\), the map will send it back to \(H_G\). So define the map</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	   \gamma: K &amp;\rightarrow Aut(H) \\
	   \gamma_k(x) &amp;\rightarrow khk^{-1}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We can use this to write the product</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) &amp;=(h_1, e)(\gamma_{k_1}(h_2),e)(e,k_1)(e, k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This \(\gamma\) just describes the conjugation of \(h_2\) by \(k_1\). And we already saw that this map is a homomorphism. Moreover, we can see the product above is now</p>
<div>
	$$

<p>Which is exactly why the semidirect product is defined that way!!!!!!!!!!

<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Take \(D_{2n}\). We need to find two subgroups that are complements in \(D_{2n}\). The subgroups are \(\langle r \rangle\) and \(\langle s \rangle\) are complements in \(D_{2n}\). To see why.</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(\langle r \rangle \langle s \rangle = D_{2n}\). Every element in \(D_{2n}\) can be written as \(r^ke \in \langle r \rangle\) or \(r^ks \in \langle s \rangle\). </li>
	<li>\(\langle r \rangle \cap \langle s \rangle = \{e\}\). But we know that \(\langle s \rangle = \{s, e\}\) and we know that \(s \not\in \langle r \rangle\) so we're done.</li>
</ul>
<p>So they are complements. The last condition we need is that one of the subgroups is normal. But we know that \(\langle r \rangle\) is normal. (We’ve shown this before).
<br />
<br />
Since we have all the conditions, then we can write</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	D_{2n} \cong \langle r \rangle \rtimes_{\gamma} \langle s \rangle
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The product will be</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(r^a, h_1)(r^b, h_2) = (r^{a}(h_1r^bh_1^{-1}), h_1h_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Since we know how to multiply elements in the dihedral group, this gives us a complete description of the semidirect product. But we can further describe this multiplication more abstractly if we let</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
    h_1r^bh_1^{-1} &amp;=  \gamma_{h_1}(r^b)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is the \(\gamma\) in the semidirect product above. \(\gamma\) tells us how to conjugate the elements. So if we define \(\gamma\) for each of the elements in both subgroups, then this gives us a way to abstract the multiplication. Since we only have two elements in \(\langle s \rangle\), then we can list what \(\gamma\) does for each element</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
     \gamma_{e}(r^b) &amp;= er^be^{-1} = r^b. \\
	 \gamma_{s}(r^b) &amp;= sr^bs^{-1} = (r^{-b}s)s^{-1} = r^{-b}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This gives up a complete description of the conjugation without ever talking about the actual multiplication. So now we can re-write the product as</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
    (r^a, h_1)(r^b, h_2) = (r^{a}\gamma_{h_1}(r^b), h_1h_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The big reason that we want to replace the conjugation with \(\gamma\) though is we don’t have elements multiplying between the two subgroups. This means that we can further abstract this with different groups that are isomorphic to the subgroups we have. In particular, we know that in \(D_{2n}\), \(\langle r \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_n\). The isomorphism is given by</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
    \langle r \rangle &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n \\
	               r^k  &amp;\rightarrow k 
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Similarly \(\langle s \rangle \mathbf{Z}_2\). The isomorphism is given by</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
    \langle s \rangle &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\
	               e  &amp;\rightarrow 0 \\
				   s &amp;\rightarrow 1
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now we can take the semidirect product that we have and replace \(\langle r \rangle\) and \(\langle s \rangle\) with their isomorphic groups \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) and \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). So we can re-write the semidirect product as</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	D_{2n} \cong \mathbf{Z}_n \rtimes_{\gamma} \mathbf{Z}_2
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now, the elements will no longer be \((r^k, h)\). Instead, they will be their images under the isomorphisms we designed. So instead of writing \(r^k\), we will write its image \(k\) and instead of writing \(e\) or \(s\), we will write 0 or 1. So</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	D_{2n} &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}_n \rtimes_{\gamma} \mathbf{Z}_2 \\
	(r^k, h)    &amp;\rightarrow          (a, x)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>And the product will be</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(r^a, h_1)(r^b, h_2) &amp;= (r^{a}\gamma_{h_1}(r^b), h_1h_2) \\
	               &amp;\rightarrow \\
   (a, x)(b, y) &amp;= (a+\gamma_{x}(b), x+y)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Note here that the group operation is now addition! The last thing we need to do is define what this new \(\gamma\) is. This will be easy since we can take the \(\gamma\) we already defined and change it to</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
     \gamma_{0}(b) &amp;= b. \\
	 \gamma_{1}(b) &amp;= -b.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To further see how this works, it’s helpful to look at more examples of how the multiplication works in the older semidirect vs. the new one.</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(r^4, e)(r^3, s) &amp;= (r^4\gamma_{e}(r^3), se) = (r^4(r^3), s) = (r^7, s)  \\
	               &amp;\rightarrow \\
   (4, 0)(3, 1) &amp;= (4+\gamma_{0}(3), 0+1) = (7, 1)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>

The following are just notes so I can fully follow along. Inner Semidirect Product Group Suppose we’re given two subgroups \(H, K \leq G\). We also know that \(HK = G\) and \(H \cap K = \{e\}\) (in this case, we call \(H\) and \(K\) complements). Consider the map $$ \begin{align*} \phi: H \times K &amp;\rightarrow G \\ (h,k) &amp;\rightarrow hk \end{align*} $$ We want to show that \(\phi\) is a bijection. To do this, we’ll first show that \(\phi\) is injective. So given the elements \(h_1, h_2 \in H\) and \(k_1, k_2 \in K\) such that \(\phi(h_1,k_1) = \phi(h_2,k_2)\), we want to show that \((h_1,k_1) = (h_2,k_2)\). Observe that $$ \begin{align*} \phi(h_1,k_1) &amp;= \phi(h_2,k_2) \\ h_1k_1 &amp;= h_2k_2 \\ (h_2)^{-1}h_1k_1 &amp;= k_2 \\ (h_2)^{-1}h_1k_1k_1^{-1} &amp;= k_2k_1^{-1} \\ (h_2)^{-1}h_1 &amp;= k_2k_1^{-1} \\ \end{align*} $$ Since \((h_2)^{-1}h_1 \in H\) and \(k_2k_1^{-1} \in K\) and \((h_2)^{-1}h_1 = k_2k_1^{-1}\), then this value must be in the intersection \(H \cap K\). But \(H \cap K = \{e\}\). Therefore, this must be the identity element and so $$ \begin{align*} (h_2)^{-1}h_1 &amp;= k_2k_1^{-1} = e \end{align*} $$ But this just means that \((h_2)^{-1}h_1 = e\) and so \(h_1 = h_2\) and similarly \(k_1 = k_2\). Therefore \((h_1,k_1) = (h_2,k_2)\). So \(\phi\) is injective. Next, we want to show that \(\phi\) is surjective. Notice that \(Im(\phi) = \{hk \ | \ h \in H, k \in K\} = HK = G\). This just means that \(\phi\) is surjective since the codomain in \(G\). Therefore, \(\phi\) is a bijection. How to Make \(\phi\) a Homomorphism Now, suppose that we’re also given that \(H\) is normal. We know that \(\phi: H \times G \rightarrow G\) is a bijection. We also know that \(G\) is a group but we never defined \(H \times K\) as a group. We just said it was a set. The question is can we make \(H \times K\) a group so that \(\phi\) isn’t just a bijection but also an isomorphism? (hmmm, this is a iff right?) We already know \(\phi\) is a bijection so we only need to show that \(\phi\) is a homomorphism. To be a homomorphism we need to prove that $$ \begin{align*} \phi((h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2)) = \phi((h_1,k_1))\phi((h_2,k_2)) \end{align*} $$ Notice that we have NOT defined what the product will look like but we know that the right hand side is $$ \begin{align*} h_1k_1h_2k_2 \end{align*} $$ The goal is to write this product as a product of an element in \(H\) multiplied by an element from \(K\). This is exactly why we wanted or need \(H\) to be normal. So insert \(k_1^{-1}k_1\) as follows $$ \begin{align*} h_1k_1h_2k_2 &amp;= h_1k_1h_2 (k_1^{-1}k_1) k_2 \\ &amp;= (h_1)(k_1h_2k_1^{-1}) (k_1k_2) \\ \end{align*} $$ Note here that the first two elements are in \(H\). \(h_1 \in H\) and \(k_1h_2k_1^{-1} \in H\) since \(H\) is normal. So we have exactly what we want. Why do we care? we want this because now we can write this as \(\phi\) of some \((h,k) \in H \times K\) where \(h = (h_1)(k_1h_2k_1^{-1})\) and \(k = (k_1k_2)\). So $$ \begin{align*} \phi((h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2)) &amp;= \phi((h_1,k_1))\phi((h_2,k_2)) \\ &amp;= h_1k_1h_2k_2 \\ &amp;= (h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}) (k_1k_2) \\ &amp;= \phi((h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}), k_1k_2) \end{align*} $$]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Study Notes: Isomorphism Theorem Examples</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/15/math417-extra-isomorphism-examples.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Study Notes: Isomorphism Theorem Examples" /><published>2025-02-15T00:01:36-08:00</published><updated>2025-02-15T00:01:36-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/15/math417-extra-isomorphism-examples</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/15/math417-extra-isomorphism-examples.html"><![CDATA[<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<p>Let \(Q_8 = \{1, -1, i, i, j, -j, k, -k\}\) be a group. We have the identities:</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, \quad ij = k, \quad ji = -k, \quad ijk = -1
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p><br />
\(ij = k\) is going in a clockwise direction while \(ji = -k\) is going in a counter clockwise direction.
TODO: Group diagram.
<br />
<br />
There are three cyclic subgroups of order 4: \(\langle i \rangle\), \(\langle j \rangle\) and \(\langle k \rangle\). There is one cyclic group of order 2: \(\langle -1 \rangle\). Note that \(\langle i \rangle = \{1, i, -1, -i\}\). 
<br />
<br />
Let’s find the cosets of \(\langle i \rangle\) in \(Q_8\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	j\langle i \rangle &amp;= j\{1, i, -1, -i\} = \{j, -k, -j, k\} \\
	\langle i \rangle j &amp;= \{1, i, -1, -i\}j = \{j, k, -j, -k\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Note that \(Q_8\) is generated by two elements \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (easy to check). Therefore, since \(j\langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle j\) and we checked all the generators of the group, then \(\langle i \rangle\) is a normal subgroup.
<br />
<br />
Let’s study the quotient group \(Q_8 / \langle i \rangle\). We know that it must contain two elements (By Lagrange’s Theorem).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	Q_8 / \langle i \rangle = \{\langle i \rangle, j \langle i \rangle\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p><br />
<br />
Recall, that we defined the multiplication of cosets by \((xN)(yN)=(xy)N\). Since we have two elements, observe that \(\langle i \rangle \langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle\). Multiply \(j \langle i \rangle\) by \(\langle i \rangle\) is just \(j \langle i \rangle\). Remember that \(\langle i \rangle\) acts as the identity element/coset here. So the only interesting product is \((j\langle i \rangle) (j\langle i \rangle)\) [TODO: add a table]</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(j\langle i \rangle) (j\langle i \rangle) &amp;= j^2 \langle i \rangle = -\langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle. 
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This multiplication table looks like the multiplication table of \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). In fact \(Q_8 / \langle i \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<p>Taking \(Q_8\) from before, let’s look at at the cyclic group generated by \(\langle -1 \rangle\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-1, 1\} 
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(\langle -1 \rangle\) is a normal subgroup (easy check, every element in the subgroup commutes with all elements in \(Q_8\)). So we now look at the quotient structure. (the cosets of \(\langle -1 \rangle\) in \(Q_8\))</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	i \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-i, i\} \\
	j \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-j, j\} \\
	k \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-k, k\} \\
	Q_8 / \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{i \langle -1 \rangle , i \langle -1 \rangle, j \langle -1 \rangle, k \langle -1 \rangle \}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Let’s calculate the order of each element. For example, \((i \langle -1 \rangle)^2 = -1\langle -1 \rangle = \langle -1 \rangle\). So \(o(i\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\). In fact, we also have \(o(j\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\) and \(o(k\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\). This isn’t cyclic so this group must be isomorphic to the non-cyclic group of order 4. So it’s isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_2\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 3</b></h4>
<p>Suppose that we are given</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: \mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n \\
	                 &amp;\phi(m) = [m] = \{k \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ k \equiv m (\bmod n)\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We want to show that \(\phi(m)\) is surjective. This is because for all \(0 \leq m \leq m - 1\), \(\phi(m) = [m]\) So we are able to hit every value of \(m\). It is also a homomorphism. since</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(m_1 + m_2) = [m_1 + m_2] = [m_1] + [m_2] = \phi(m_1) + \phi(m_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The kernel of \(\phi\) is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ m \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ [m] = [0]\} \\
	           &amp;= \{0, \pm n, \pm 2n,....\} = n\mathbf{Z}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now we have \(\ker(\phi) = n\mathbf{Z}\). We know that it is normal. We also showed that \(\phi\) is a surjective homomorphism. Therefore, by the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}/n\mathbf{Z} \cong \mathbf{Z}_n\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 4</b></h4>
<p>Next, let’s take</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: \mathbf{Z}_4 &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\
	        &amp;\phi([m]_4) = [m]_2 
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Here, it is not obvious this is well-defined. So let’s check that it is. Suppose that \([m_1]_4 = [m_2]_4\). We want to show that \(\phi([m_1]_4) = \phi([m_2]_4)\). Observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	[m_1]_4 &amp;= [m_2]_4 \\
	[m_1]_4 - [m_2]_4 &amp;= [0]_4 \\
	[m_1 - m_2]_4 &amp;= [0]_4 \\
	m_1-m_2 &amp;\equiv 0 \bmod 4
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This says that \(m_1 - m_2\) must be a multiple of 4 so \(m_1 - m_2 = 4k = 2(2k)\) for some \(k \in \mathbf{Z}\). So \(m_1 - m_2\) is also a multiple of 2. Therefore, \(m_1-m_2 \equiv 0 \bmod 2\) and so \([m_1]_2 = [m_2]_2\).
<br />
<br />
\(\phi\) is also a homomorphism. since</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi([m_1]_4 + [m_2]_4) = \phi([m_1 + m_2]_4) = [m_1 + m_2]_2 = [m_1]_2 + [m_2]_2 = \phi(m_1) + \phi(m_2).
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Next we want to show that \(\phi\) is surjective. Notice that there are two values in the target domain. \([0]_2\) and \([1]_2\). Also note that \(\phi([0]_4) = [0]_2\) and \(\phi([1]_4) = [1]_2\) so it is surjective.
<br />
<br />
The kernel of \(\phi\) is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ [m]_4 \in \mathbf{Z}_4 \ | \ \phi([m]_4) = [0]_2\} \\
	           &amp;= \{ [m]_4 \in \mathbf{Z}_4 \ | \ [m]_2 = [0]_2\} \\
			   &amp;= \{ [0]_4, [2]_4 \} = \langle [2]_4 \rangle = 2\mathbf{Z}_4 \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now we have \(\ker(\phi) = \langle [2]_4 \rangle\). We know that it is normal. We also showed that \(\phi\) is a surjective homomorphism. Therefore, by the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}_4/\langle [2]_4 \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 5</b></h4>
<p>Next, let’s take</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: \mathbf{Z}_6 &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_{15}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We need to figure out a homomorphism. First recall that for any element, \(|\phi(x)| \ | \ |x|\). Let’s list the order of the elements in \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\). Notice here that \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\) is a cyclic group (with addition) so the order of any element \(g + a\) is going to be \(\frac{15}{gcd(a,15)}\)</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	&amp;o(1): [0]_{15} \\
	&amp;o(3): [5]_{15}, [10]_{15} \\
	&amp;o(5): [3]_{15}, [6]_{15}, [9]_{15}, [12]_{15} \\
	&amp;o(15): [1]_{15}, [2]_{15}, [4]_{15}, [7]_{15}, [11]_{15}, [13]_{15}, [14]_{15} \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now let’s pick \([1]_{6}\). It is a generator for \(\mathbf{Z}_{6}\). We know that \(\phi([1]_6)\) must divide the order of the element itself so \(|[1]_6| = 6\). So that tells us that \(|\phi([1]_6)|\) must be either 1,2,3 or 6. 2 and 6 are not possibilities so we don’t have any elements of that order in \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\). So it’s either 1 or 3.
<br />
<br />
Case 1: Suppose we pick some element of order 1. That means that \(\phi([1]_6) = 1\). This implies that \(\phi([1]_6) = [0]_{15}\). Since it’s a generator, then \(\ker(\phi) = \mathbf{Z}_6\). And \(Im(\phi) = \{[0]_{15}\}\). This gives us \(\mathbf{Z}_6/\mathbf{Z}_6 = \{[0]_{15}\} \leq \mathbf{Z}_{15}\). So it’s pretty boring.
<br />
<br />
Case 2: Suppose we pick some element of order 3 so \(|\phi([1]_6)| = 3\). So let \(\phi([1]_6) = [5]_{15}\). Based on this, where will \([2]_6\) will go? Remember that we want \(\phi\) to be a homomorphism. This means that we want this to be true. That \(\phi([2]_6) = \phi([1 + 1]_6) = \phi([1]_6) + \phi([1]_6) = [5]_{15} + [5_{15} = [10]_{15}\). So we want to pick \([10]_{15}\) for \([2]_6\). Based on this, the elements will get mapped to</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	[0]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [0]_{15} \\
	[1]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [5]_{15} \\
	[2]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [10]_{15} \\
	[3]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [0]_{15} \\
	[4]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [5]_{15} \\
	[5]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [10]_{15}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So the image of our homomorphism is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	Im(\phi) = \{[0]_{15}, [5]_{15}, [10]_{15}\} = \langle [5]_{15} \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_3
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The last statement is because all cyclic groups of order 3 are isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_3\). The kernel of \(\phi\) is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ [m]_6 \in \mathbf{Z}_6 \ | \ \phi([m]_6) = [0]_{15}\} \\
			   &amp;= \{ [0]_6, [3]_{6} \} = \langle [3]_6 \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>By the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}_{6}/\langle [3]_6 \rangle \cong \langle [5]_{15} \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_3\).
<br />

<h4><b>Example 11</b></h4>
<p>Suppose now we have the following map</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: D_{6} &amp;\rightarrow S_6 \\
	      r  &amp;\rightarrow (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6) \\
		  s &amp;\rightarrow (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is easy to see if we draw a hexagon and label the vertices as follows</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/extra/1.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>So we can see that a reflection about the \(y\) axis is represented by the above map. So now we want to check if \(\phi\) defines a homomorphism. We do this by checking the defining relations in \(D_6\) So we want \(\phi(r^6) = \phi(e) = (1) = e_{S_6}\). But this is also</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(r^6) = (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)^6 = e
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Similarly, we have \(\phi(s^2) = \phi(e) = [0]\) and it easy to check that we do get \(\phi(s^2) = e\). Finally, we have \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{5})\). We can check both sides</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(rs) &amp;= (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6) (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) = (1)(2 \ 6)(3 \ 5)(4) = (2 \ 6)(3 \ 5) \\

	               &amp;= (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) (1 \ 6 \ 5 \ 4 \ 3 \ 2) \quad \text{(we can count by 5)} \\
				   &amp;= (1)(2 \ 6)(3 \ 5)(4) = (2 \ 6)(3 \ 5) 
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The image of \(\phi\) is going to be generating by \((1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)\) and \((1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4)\)</p>
<div>

	$$
</div>
<p>We claim that the kernel only contains the identity. Why? note that \(|r| = 6\) and the order of its image is \(|(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)|\). This tells us</p>
<div>

	\begin{align*}

We have the identities: $$ \begin{align*} i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, \quad ij = k, \quad ji = -k, \quad ijk = -1 \end{align*} $$ \(ij = k\) is going in a clockwise direction while \(ji = -k\) is going in a counter clockwise direction. TODO: Group diagram. There are three cyclic subgroups of order 4: \(\langle i \rangle\), \(\langle j \rangle\) and \(\langle k \rangle\). There is one cyclic group of order 2: \(\langle -1 \rangle\). Note that \(\langle i \rangle = \{1, i, -1, -i\}\). Let’s find the cosets of \(\langle i \rangle\) in \(Q_8\). $$ \begin{align*} j\langle i \rangle &amp;= j\{1, i, -1, -i\} = \{j, -k, -j, k\} \\ \langle i \rangle j &amp;= \{1, i, -1, -i\}j = \{j, k, -j, -k\} \end{align*} $$ Note that \(Q_8\) is generated by two elements \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (easy to check). Therefore, since \(j\langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle j\) and we checked all the generators of the group, then \(\langle i \rangle\) is a normal subgroup. Let’s study the quotient group \(Q_8 / \langle i \rangle\). We know that it must contain two elements (By Lagrange’s Theorem). $$ \begin{align*} Q_8 / \langle i \rangle = \{\langle i \rangle, j \langle i \rangle\} \end{align*} $$ Recall, that we defined the multiplication of cosets by \((xN)(yN)=(xy)N\). Since we have two elements, observe that \(\langle i \rangle \langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle\). Multiply \(j \langle i \rangle\) by \(\langle i \rangle\) is just \(j \langle i \rangle\). Remember that \(\langle i \rangle\) acts as the identity element/coset here. So the only interesting product is \((j\langle i \rangle) (j\langle i \rangle)\) [TODO: add a table] $$ \begin{align*} (j\langle i \rangle) (j\langle i \rangle) &amp;= j^2 \langle i \rangle = -\langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle. \end{align*} $$ This multiplication table looks like the multiplication table of \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). In fact \(Q_8 / \langle i \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\). Example 2 Taking \(Q_8\) from before, let’s look at at the cyclic group generated by \(\langle -1 \rangle\). $$ \begin{align*} \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-1, 1\} \end{align*} $$ \(\langle -1 \rangle\) is a normal subgroup (easy check, every element in the subgroup commutes with all elements in \(Q_8\)). So we now look at the quotient structure. (the cosets of \(\langle -1 \rangle\) in \(Q_8\)) $$ \begin{align*} i \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-i, i\} \\ j \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-j, j\} \\ k \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-k, k\} \\ Q_8 / \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{i \langle -1 \rangle , i \langle -1 \rangle, j \langle -1 \rangle, k \langle -1 \rangle \} \end{align*} $$ Let’s calculate the order of each element. For example, \((i \langle -1 \rangle)^2 = -1\langle -1 \rangle = \langle -1 \rangle\). So \(o(i\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\). In fact, we also have \(o(j\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\) and \(o(k\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\). This isn’t cyclic so this group must be isomorphic to the non-cyclic group of order 4. So it’s isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_2\). Example 3 Suppose that we are given $$ \begin{align*} \phi: \mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n \\ &amp;\phi(m) = [m] = \{k \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ k \equiv m (\bmod n)\} \end{align*} $$ We want to show that \(\phi(m)\) is surjective. This is because for all \(0 \leq m \leq m - 1\), \(\phi(m) = [m]\) So we are able to hit every value of \(m\). It is also a homomorphism. since $$ \begin{align*} \phi(m_1 + m_2) = [m_1 + m_2] = [m_1] + [m_2] = \phi(m_1) + \phi(m_2) \end{align*} $$ The kernel of \(\phi\) is $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ m \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ [m] = [0]\} \\ &amp;= \{0, \pm n, \pm 2n,....\} = n\mathbf{Z} \end{align*} $$ So now we have \(\ker(\phi) = n\mathbf{Z}\). We know that it is normal. We also showed that \(\phi\) is a surjective homomorphism. Therefore, by the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}/n\mathbf{Z} \cong \mathbf{Z}_n\). Example 4 Next, let’s take $$ \begin{align*} \phi: \mathbf{Z}_4 &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\ &amp;\phi([m]_4) = [m]_2 \end{align*} $$ Here, it is not obvious this is well-defined. So let’s check that it is. Suppose that \([m_1]_4 = [m_2]_4\). We want to show that \(\phi([m_1]_4) = \phi([m_2]_4)\). Observe that $$ \begin{align*} [m_1]_4 &amp;= [m_2]_4 \\ [m_1]_4 - [m_2]_4 &amp;= [0]_4 \\ [m_1 - m_2]_4 &amp;= [0]_4 \\ m_1-m_2 &amp;\equiv 0 \bmod 4 \end{align*} $$ This says that \(m_1 - m_2\) must be a multiple of 4 so \(m_1 - m_2 = 4k = 2(2k)\) for some \(k \in \mathbf{Z}\). So \(m_1 - m_2\) is also a multiple of 2. Therefore, \(m_1-m_2 \equiv 0 \bmod 2\) and so \([m_1]_2 = [m_2]_2\). \(\phi\) is also a homomorphism. since $$ \begin{align*} \phi([m_1]_4 + [m_2]_4) = \phi([m_1 + m_2]_4) = [m_1 + m_2]_2 = [m_1]_2 + [m_2]_2 = \phi(m_1) + \phi(m_2). \end{align*} $$ Next we want to show that \(\phi\) is surjective. Notice that there are two values in the target domain. \([0]_2\) and \([1]_2\). Also note that \(\phi([0]_4) = [0]_2\) and \(\phi([1]_4) = [1]_2\) so it is surjective. The kernel of \(\phi\) is $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ [m]_4 \in \mathbf{Z}_4 \ | \ \phi([m]_4) = [0]_2\} \\ &amp;= \{ [m]_4 \in \mathbf{Z}_4 \ | \ [m]_2 = [0]_2\} \\ &amp;= \{ [0]_4, [2]_4 \} = \langle [2]_4 \rangle = 2\mathbf{Z}_4 \\ \end{align*} $$ So now we have \(\ker(\phi) = \langle [2]_4 \rangle\). We know that it is normal. We also showed that \(\phi\) is a surjective homomorphism. Therefore, by the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}_4/\langle [2]_4 \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\). Example 5 Next, let’s take $$ \begin{align*} \phi: \mathbf{Z}_6 &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_{15} \end{align*} $$ We need to figure out a homomorphism. First recall that for any element, \(|\phi(x)| \ | \ |x|\). Let’s list the order of the elements in \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\). Notice here that \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\) is a cyclic group (with addition) so the order of any element \(g + a\) is going to be \(\frac{15}{gcd(a,15)}\) $$ \begin{align*} &amp;o(1): [0]_{15} \\ &amp;o(3): [5]_{15}, [10]_{15} \\ &amp;o(5): [3]_{15}, [6]_{15}, [9]_{15}, [12]_{15} \\ &amp;o(15): [1]_{15}, [2]_{15}, [4]_{15}, [7]_{15}, [11]_{15}, [13]_{15}, [14]_{15} \\ \end{align*} $$ So now let’s pick \([1]_{6}\). It is a generator for \(\mathbf{Z}_{6}\). We know that \(\phi([1]_6)\) must divide the order of the element itself so \(|[1]_6| = 6\). So that tells us that \(|\phi([1]_6)|\) must be either 1,2,3 or 6. 2 and 6 are not possibilities so we don’t have any elements of that order in \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\). So it’s either 1 or 3. Case 1: Suppose we pick some element of order 1. That means that \(\phi([1]_6) = 1\). This implies that \(\phi([1]_6) = [0]_{15}\). Since it’s a generator, then \(\ker(\phi) = \mathbf{Z}_6\). And \(Im(\phi) = \{[0]_{15}\}\). This gives us \(\mathbf{Z}_6/\mathbf{Z}_6 = \{[0]_{15}\} \leq \mathbf{Z}_{15}\). So it’s pretty boring. Case 2: Suppose we pick some element of order 3 so \(|\phi([1]_6)| = 3\). So let \(\phi([1]_6) = [5]_{15}\). Based on this, where will \([2]_6\) will go? Remember that we want \(\phi\) to be a homomorphism. This means that we want this to be true. That \(\phi([2]_6) = \phi([1 + 1]_6) = \phi([1]_6) + \phi([1]_6) = [5]_{15} + [5_{15} = [10]_{15}\). So we want to pick \([10]_{15}\) for \([2]_6\). Based on this, the elements will get mapped to $$ \begin{align*} [0]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [0]_{15} \\ [1]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [5]_{15} \\ [2]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [10]_{15} \\ [3]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [0]_{15} \\ [4]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [5]_{15} \\ [5]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [10]_{15}. \end{align*} $$ So the image of our homomorphism is $$ \begin{align*} Im(\phi) = \{[0]_{15}, [5]_{15}, [10]_{15}\} = \langle [5]_{15} \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_3 \end{align*} $$ The last statement is because all cyclic groups of order 3 are isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_3\). The kernel of \(\phi\) is $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ [m]_6 \in \mathbf{Z}_6 \ | \ \phi([m]_6) = [0]_{15}\} \\ &amp;= \{ [0]_6, [3]_{6} \} = \langle [3]_6 \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\\ \end{align*} $$ By the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}_{6}/\langle [3]_6 \rangle \cong \langle [5]_{15} \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_3\). Example 6 Next, let’s take $$ \begin{align*} D_n = \langle r,s \ | \ r^n = s^2 = e, rs = sr^{n-1} \rangle \end{align*} $$ To define a homomorphism, we need these defining identities to hold on both sides. So let’s define $$ \begin{align*} \phi: D_n &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\ r &amp;\rightarrow 0 \quad \text{we don't to write $[0]_2$ since it's clear} \\ s &amp;\rightarrow 1 \end{align*} $$ So now we need to verify that the three defining relations are satisfied. For example, we know that \(r^n = e\). So we want \(\phi(r^n) = \phi(e) = [0]\). But this is also $$ \begin{align*} \phi(r^n) = \phi(rr...r) = \phi(r)+...\phi(r) = 0+...+0 = 0. \end{align*} $$ Similarly, we have \(\phi(s^2) = \phi(e) = [0]\) and at the same time $$ \begin{align*} \phi(s^2) = \phi(ss) = \phi(s)+\phi(s) = 1 + 1 = 0 \end{align*} $$ Finally, we have \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{n-1})\). We can check both sides $$ \begin{align*} \phi(rs) &amp;= \phi(r) + \phi(s) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\ \phi(sr^{n-1}) &amp;= \phi(s) + \phi(r) + ... + \phi(r) = 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1 \end{align*} $$ Next, we need to see that it is surjective but that’s trivial since we’re sending \(r\) to \(0\) and \(s\) to \(1\) so it’s definitely surjective. The image of \(\phi\) is \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). The kernel is also easy to see $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ l \in D_n \ | \ \phi(l) = 0\} \\ &amp;= \langle r \rangle \\ \end{align*} $$ This is because any rotation is sent to 0 and any reflection \(\phi(r^ks) = \phi(sr^{n-k} = 1\). By the Isomorphism Theorem, \(D_n/\langle r \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\). Example 7 Let’s continue with the dihedral group and suppose we have $$ \begin{align*} D_n = \langle r,s \ | \ r^n = s^2 = e, rs = sr^{n-1} \rangle \end{align*} $$ To define a homomorphism, we need these defining identities to hold on both sides. So let’s define $$ \begin{align*} \phi: D_n &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n \\ r &amp;\rightarrow 1 \\ s &amp;\rightarrow 0 \end{align*} $$ Is this a homomorphism? Let’s check the identity \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{n-1})\). We can check both sides $$ \begin{align*} \phi(rs) &amp;= \phi(r) + \phi(s) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\ \phi(sr^{n-1}) &amp;= \phi(s) + (\phi(r) + ... + \phi(r)) = 0 + n - 1 = n - 1. \end{align*} $$ Note that \(1 \not\equiv n - 1 \bmod n\) unless \(n = 2\). So it’s not a homomorphism for any \(n &gt; 2\). Example 8 Let’s take another dihedral group example. Define $$ \begin{align*} D_{2n} = \langle r,s \ | \ r^{2n} = s^2 = e, rs = sr^{2n-1} \rangle \end{align*} $$ And then define $$ \begin{align*} \phi: D_{2n} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\ r &amp;\rightarrow 1 \\ s &amp;\rightarrow 0 \end{align*} $$ We need to verify that the three defining relations are satisfied. For example, we know that \(r^{2n} = e\). So we want \(\phi(r^{2n}) = \phi(e) = [0]\). But this is also $$ \begin{align*} \phi(r^{2n}) = 2n\phi(r) = [2n]_2 = 0. \end{align*} $$ Similarly, we have \(\phi(s^2) = \phi(e) = [0]\) and at the same time $$ \begin{align*} \phi(s^2) = \phi(ss) = \phi(s)+\phi(s) = 0 \end{align*} $$ Finally, we have \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{n-1})\). We can check both sides $$ \begin{align*} \phi(rs) &amp;= \phi(r) + \phi(s) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\ \phi(sr^{2n-1}) &amp;= 0 + 2n-1 = [2n-1]_2 = 1 \end{align*} $$ So \(\phi\) is a homomorphism. It is surjective since we hit both elements in the target. Next we’ll calculate the kernel. $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ l \in D_n \ | \ \phi(l) = [0]_2\} \\ &amp;= \{e, r^2, r^4 ... r^{2n-2}, s, sr^2 ... sr^{2n-2} \} \\ &amp;= \langle s, r^2 \rangle \leq D_{2n}\\ &amp;= \langle s, r^2 \ | \ s^2=(r^2)^{n} = e, r^2s = s(r^2)^{n-1} \rangle \cong D_n \end{align*} $$ By the Isomorphism Theorem, \(D_{2n}/D_n \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\). Example 11 Suppose now we have the following map $$ \begin{align*} \phi: D_{6} &amp;\rightarrow S_6 \\ r &amp;\rightarrow (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6) \\ s &amp;\rightarrow (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) \end{align*} $$ This is easy to see if we draw a hexagon and label the vertices as follows So we can see that a reflection about the \(y\) axis is represented by the above map. So now we want to check if \(\phi\) defines a homomorphism. We do this by checking the defining relations in \(D_6\) So we want \(\phi(r^6) = \phi(e) = (1) = e_{S_6}\). But this is also $$ \begin{align*} \phi(r^6) = (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)^6 = e \end{align*} $$ Similarly, we have \(\phi(s^2) = \phi(e) = [0]\) and it easy to check that we do get \(\phi(s^2) = e\). Finally, we have \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{5})\). We can check both sides $$ \begin{align*} \phi(rs) &amp;= (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6) (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) = (1)(2 \ 6)(3 \ 5)(4) = (2 \ 6)(3 \ 5) \\ \phi(sr^{n-1}) &amp;= (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)^5 \\ &amp;= (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) (1 \ 6 \ 5 \ 4 \ 3 \ 2) \quad \text{(we can count by 5)} \\ &amp;= (1)(2 \ 6)(3 \ 5)(4) = (2 \ 6)(3 \ 5) \end{align*} $$ The image of \(\phi\) is going to be generating by \((1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)\) and \((1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4)\) $$ \begin{align*} im(\phi) &amp;= \langle (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6), (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) \rangle \\ \end{align*} $$ We claim that the kernel only contains the identity. Why? note that \(|r| = 6\) and the order of its image is \(|(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)|\). This tells us $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ l \in D_n \ | \ \phi(l) = 0\} \\ &amp;= \langle r \rangle \\ \end{align*} $$ References The order of an element in a direct group is the lcm of both elements orders Isomorphism Examples]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Study Notes: Extra Proofs …</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/14/math417-extra-proofs.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Study Notes: Extra Proofs …" /><published>2025-02-14T00:01:36-08:00</published><updated>2025-02-14T00:01:36-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/14/math417-extra-proofs</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/14/math417-extra-proofs.html"><![CDATA[<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>

Proposition

<div class="peachbodydiv">
Suppose \((x,y) \in G_1 \times G_2\) and that the order of the elements are \(|x| = r\) and \(|y| = s\). Then the order of \((x,y)\) is \(lcm(r,s)\)
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Let \(l = lcm(r,s)\). Then, \(l = ra = sb\) for some \(r, b \in \mathbf{Z}\). Observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(x,y)^{l} &amp;= (x^l, y^l) = (x^{ra}, y^{sb}) = (e_1, e_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>From this we see that the order of \((x,y)\) must divide \(l\). If we let \(l' = |(x,y)|\), then  \(l' \ | \ l\). Now, observe that</p>

	\begin{align*}
	(x,y)^{l'} &amp;= (x^{l'}, y^{l'}) = (e_1, e_2)

<p>But since \(|x| = r\) and \(|y| = s\), then \(r \ | \ l'\) and \(s \ | \ l'\). But this means that \(lcm(r,s) = l \ | \ l'\). Since \(l' \ | \ l\) and \(l \ | \ l'\), then \(l = l'\) as we wanted to show.

Proposition

<div class="peachbodydiv">
\(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n \cong \mathbf{Z}_{mn}\) if and only if \(gcd(m,n) = 1\)

<p><br />
This says if you take the product of two cyclic groups, then their product is cyclic if and only if \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime.
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
\(\longrightarrow:\) Suppose \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n \cong \mathbf{Z}_{mn}\). Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(gcd(m,n) = d &gt; 1\). Now, take an arbitrary element \((a,b) \in \mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\). Add \((a,b)+...+(a,b)\) \(\frac{mn}{d}\) times. We will see that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(a\frac{mn}{d},b\frac{mn}{d}) &amp;= (a\frac{n}{d}m,b\frac{m}{d}n) \\
	                              &amp;= ([0]_m, [0]_n)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Notice here that both \(\frac{n}{d}\) and \(\frac{m}{d}\) are whole numbers since \(d\) is a divisor of both \(m\) and \(n\). So the first entry is a multiple of \(m\) while the second entry is a multiple of \(n\). This implies that the order of \((a,b) \leq \frac{mn}{d} &lt; mn\). So the order of any element \((a,b) \in \mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\) is strictly less than \(mn\). This means that no element of \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\) can be a generator of the group. So \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\) is not cyclic. This is a contradiction because \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\) isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_{mn}\) and so it is cyclic. 
<br />
<br />
\(\longleftarrow:\) Now suppose that \(gcd(m,n) = 1\). We want to show that \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_{mn}\). Notice that the order of the element 1 has order \(m\) in \(\mathbf{Z}_m\) and the order of the element 1 has order \(n\) in \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). This tells us that the order of \((1,1) = lcm(m,n) \frac{mn}{gcd(m,n)} \frac{mn}{1} = mn\). So \((1,1)\) has order \(mn\) which means it generates the group. So it must be cyclic. So \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n = \langle (1,1) \rangle\). We know all cyclic groups that have the same order are isomorphic. So \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n \cong \mathbf{Z}_{mn}\).
