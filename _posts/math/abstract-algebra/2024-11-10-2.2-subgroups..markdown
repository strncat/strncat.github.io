Definition 2.2.1
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
A non-empty subset \(H\) of a group \(G\) is called a subgroup if \(H\) is itself a group with the group operation inherited from \(G\). We write \(H \leq G\) to indicate that \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\).
</div>
<br>
The necessary conditions for a subset \(H\) of \(G\) to be a subgroup of \(G\) are:
<ol>
	<li>Closed under multiplication. That is, for all elements \(h_1\) and \(h_2\) of \(H\), the products \(h_1h_2\) is also an element of \(H\)</li>
	<li>Closed under inverses. For all \(h \in H\), the inverse \(h^{-1}\) is an element of \(H\)</li>
</ol>
By $$(2)$$ we know for any $$h \in H$$, $$h^{-1} \in H$$ and by (1), we know that $$hh^{-1}=e \in H$$. So the identity element is in $$H$$. Associativity is inherited from $$GG$$. From this we see that these two conditions are sufficient for $$H$$ to be a subgroup of $$G$$. Sometimes, it is easier to prove that a set is a subgroup rather than proving that it is a group since we only need to check these two conditions.

Proposition 2.2.8 (Uniqueness of the identity)
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(H_1, H_2,...,H_n\) be subgroups of \(G\). Then \(H_1 \cap H_2 \cap ... \cap H_n \) is a subgroup of \(G\). More generally, if \(\{H_{\alpha}\}\) is any collection of subgroups, then \(\cap_{\alpha}\) is a subgroup.
