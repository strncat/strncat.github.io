<p>Let \((a_n) = (-1)^n\). Consider the subsequence \((a_{2n})\). This is a subsequence of \((a_n)\). \(a_{2n}\) is</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}

$$
</div>
<p>This subsequence converges to 1. Consider now the subsequence \((a_{2n}) = \{-1,-1,-1,-1,....\}\). This subsequence converges to -1. Since \((a_n)\) has two subsequences that converge to two different limits than \((a_n)\) must diverge due to <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/21/analysis-seq-subseq-divergence.html">this</a>.

<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \((a_n)\) be a sequence and let two subsequences converge to different limits or have a subsequence diverge. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \((a_n)\) converges to a limit \(a\). This means that every subsequence of \((a_{n_k})\) must converge \(a\) by the proof we did earlier <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/19/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence.html">here</a>. But this is a contradiction since we assumed that two subsequences converge to different limits or that a subsequence diverges. Therefore, \((a_n)\) must diverge as required. \(\blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Discussion:</b></h4>
<p>We already did the direction every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence in <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/17/analysis-seq-convergent-sequences-are-cauchy.html">here</a>.

	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - l| \leq \epsilon \quad \text{whenever $n &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>But we don’t know what \(l\) is. How can we come up with such a candidate?? the trick is to use other theorems to get us there. In particular this proof uses the fact that every Cauchy sequence is bounded and then uses the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem to conclude that there must exist a subsequence that is convergent from the original sequence. This limit is a good candidate because we also proved earlier that subsequences converge to the same limit as the original sequence in <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/11/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence.html">here</a>)
<br />
<br />
So now we can go back and figure out what \(N\) would work here. We have \(|a_n - l|\). We can do the same exact trick of adding and subtracting the same term and then using the triangle inequality to come up with good candidate.
<br /> 
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>The direction, a convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence is proved <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/17/analysis-seq-convergent-sequences-are-cauchy.html">here</a>. For the other direction, we want to prove that if a sequence is Cauchy then it is convergent. Let \((a_n)\) be a Cauchy sequence. This means that \((a_n)\) is bounded by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/16/analysis-seq-cauchy-bounded.html">the proof we did earlier</a>. And since \((a_n)\) is bounded, then by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/14/analysis-seq-subseq-bolzano-weierstrass-theorem.html">the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem</a>, we know that we must have a subsequence that is convergent. Let this subsequence be \((a_{n_k})\) and let \((a_{n_k}) \rightarrow l\). We will use \(l\) as the convergence candidate for \((a_n)\).
<br />
<br />
Since \((a_n)\) is Cauchy, then there exists \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - a_m| \leq \frac{\epsilon}{2} \quad \text{whenever $n, m &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We also know that \((a_{n_k}) \rightarrow l\). Let \(a_{n_K}\) be a term from the subsequence \((a_{n_k})\) such that \(n_K &gt; N\). Therefore, the following holds</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_{n_K} - l| \leq \frac{\epsilon}{2} \quad \text{whenever $n_K &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To prove that \((a_n) \rightarrow l\), we’ll prove that \(|a_n - l| \leq \epsilon\) whenever \(n &gt; N\). To see that, we’ll add and subtract \(a_{n_K}\) and then use the triangular inequality to bound the term,</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - l| &amp;= |a_n + a_{n_K} - a_{n_K} - l| \\
	          &amp;\leq |a_n - a_{n_K}| + |a_{n_K} - l| \\
			  &amp;&lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Therefore, \((a_n)\) converges to \(l\) as we wanted to show. \(\blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Discussion:</b></h4>
<p>We want to find \(N\) such that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_m - a_n| &lt; \epsilon \quad \text{whenever $n, m &gt; N$}.

<p>If we start with \(|a_m - a_n|\) then we can use the trick of adding and subtracting the limit inside the absolute value. We do this because we are hoping to use the triangle inequality to bound the term \(|a_m - a_n|\) so</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_m - a_n| &amp;= |a_m - l + l - a_n| \\
	&amp;\leq |a_m - l| + |l - a_n|.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Our goal is to bound the term to be less than \(\epsilon\) and now we have \(|a_m - l|\) and \(|l - a_n|\). But we already know that the sequence \((a_n)\) is convergent so we can have \(|a_n - l|\) be less than any \(\epsilon\) we like as long as \(n &gt; N\). Here we can see that choosing \(\epsilon/2\) will get us to \(\epsilon\) like we want to.
<br /> 
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \((a_n)\) be a convergent sequence. Let \((a_n) \rightarrow l\). This means that for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), there must exist a number \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that</p>

	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - l| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} \quad \text{whenever $n &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}

<p>To prove that \((a_n)\) is cauchy, we need to prove that for \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) and for \(n, m &gt; N\), then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_m - a_n| &lt; \epsilon \quad \text{whenever $n, m &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To see this, consider \(|a_m - a_n|\). Add and subtract the limit \(l\) and then use triangle inequality to achieve the following</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_m - a_n| &amp;= |a_m - l + l - a_n| \\
	&amp;\leq |a_m - l| + |l - a_n|.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>But now we know that \((a_n)\) converges to \(l\). We have already established the bound \(|a_n - l| &lt; \epsilon/2\) earlier so for \(n, m &gt; N\),</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_m - a_n| &amp;\leq |a_m - l| + |l - a_n| \\
	&amp;&lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon.

<p>From this we see that \((a_n)\) is a Cauchy sequence as we wanted to show. \(\blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \((a_n)\) be a cauchy sequence and let \(\epsilon = 1\). By definition, this means that there exists a number \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - a_m| &lt; 1 \quad \text{whenever $m, n &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Fix \(a_m\) such that \(m = N+1\). Since \(N+1 &gt; N\), then the following holds</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - a_{N+1}| \leq 1 \quad \text{whenever $n &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Now we can expand the above inequality to</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	-1 \leq a_n - a_{N+1} &amp;\leq 1 \\
	a_{N+1} - 1 \leq a_n &amp;\leq 1 + a_{N+1}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>From this, we can see that we have established a bound on all the terms of the sequence starting after the \(N\)th term. For earlier terms, we can establish a bound by defining the lower and upper bounds as</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	L = \min\{a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_N, a_{N+1}-1\}, \\
	U = \min\{a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_N, a_{N+1}+1\}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(L\) is a lower bound on any term that comes on or before the \(N\)th term and similarly \(U\) is an upper bound on all the terms that comes on or before the \(N\)th. Therefore \((a_n)\) is bounded. \(\blacksquare\)

Since \(N+1 &gt; N\), then the following holds $$ \begin{align*} |a_n - a_{N+1}| \leq 1 \quad \text{whenever $n &gt; N$}. \end{align*} $$ Now we can expand the above inequality to $$ \begin{align*} -1 \leq a_n - a_{N+1} &amp;\leq 1 \\ a_{N+1} - 1 \leq a_n &amp;\leq 1 + a_{N+1}. \end{align*} $$ From this, we can see that we have established a bound on all the terms of the sequence starting after the \(N\)th term. For earlier terms, we can establish a bound by defining the lower and upper bounds as $$ \begin{align*} L = \min\{a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_N, a_{N+1}-1\}, \\ U = \min\{a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_N, a_{N+1}+1\}. \end{align*} $$ \(L\) is a lower bound on any term that comes on or before the \(N\)th term and similarly \(U\) is an upper bound on all the terms that comes on or before the \(N\)th. Therefore \((a_n)\) is bounded. \(\blacksquare\) References: Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott Wrath of Math Youtube Channel]]></summary></entry></feed>
