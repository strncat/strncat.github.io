<p>Let \((a_n)\) be a sequence and let two subsequences converge to different limits or have a subsequence diverge. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \((a_n)\) converges to a limit \(a\). This means that every subsequence of \((a_{n_k})\) must converge \(a\) by the proof we did earlier <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/19/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence.html">here</a>.

Therefore, \((a_n)\) also converges to \(a\). \(\blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Discussion:</b></h4>
<p>We already did the direction every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence in <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/17/analysis-seq-convergent-sequences-are-cauchy.html">here</a>. For the second part where we want to prove that a Cauchy sequence converges, we want to find \(N\) such that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - l| \leq \epsilon \quad \text{whenever $n &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>But we don’t know what \(l\) is. How can we come up with such a candidate?? the trick is to use other theorems to get us there. In particular this proof uses the fact that every Cauchy sequence is bounded and then uses the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem to conclude that there must exist a subsequence that is convergent from the original sequence. This limit is a good candidate because we also proved earlier that subsequences converge to the same limit as the original sequence in <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/11/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence.html">here</a>)
<br />
<br />
So now we can go back and figure out what \(N\) would work here. We have \(|a_n - l|\). We can do the same exact trick of adding and subtracting the same term and then using the triangle inequality to come up with good candidate.
<br /> 
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>The direction, a convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence is proved <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/17/analysis-seq-convergent-sequences-are-cauchy.html">here</a>. For the other direction, we want to prove that if a sequence is Cauchy then it is convergent. Let \((a_n)\) be a Cauchy sequence. This means that \((a_n)\) is bounded by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/16/analysis-seq-cauchy-bounded.html">the proof we did earlier</a>. And since \((a_n)\) is bounded, then by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/14/analysis-seq-subseq-bolzano-weierstrass-theorem.html">the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem</a>, we know that we must have a subsequence that is convergent. Let this subsequence be \((a_{n_k})\) and let \((a_{n_k}) \rightarrow l\). We will use \(l\) as the convergence candidate for \((a_n)\).
<br />
<br />
Since \((a_n)\) is Cauchy, then there exists \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - a_m| \leq \frac{\epsilon}{2} \quad \text{whenever $n, m &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We also know that \((a_{n_k}) \rightarrow l\). Let \(a_{n_K}\) be a term from the subsequence \((a_{n_k})\) such that \(n_K &gt; N\). Therefore, the following holds</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_{n_K} - l| \leq \frac{\epsilon}{2} \quad \text{whenever $n_K &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To prove that \((a_n) \rightarrow l\), we’ll prove that \(|a_n - l| \leq \epsilon\) whenever \(n &gt; N\). To see that, we’ll add and subtract \(a_{n_K}\) and then use the triangular inequality to bound the term,</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - l| &amp;= |a_n + a_{n_K} - a_{n_K} - l| \\
	          &amp;\leq |a_n - a_{n_K}| + |a_{n_K} - l| \\
			  &amp;&lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Therefore, \((a_n)\) converges to \(l\) as we wanted to show. \(\blacksquare\)

	|a_m - a_n| &lt; \epsilon \quad \text{whenever $n, m &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>If we start with \(|a_m - a_n|\) then we can use the trick of adding and subtracting the limit inside the absolute value. We do this because we are hoping to use the triangle inequality to bound the term \(|a_m - a_n|\) so</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_m - a_n| &amp;= |a_m - l + l - a_n| \\
	&amp;\leq |a_m - l| + |l - a_n|.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Our goal is to bound the term to be less than \(\epsilon\) and now we have \(|a_m - l|\) and \(|l - a_n|\). But we already know that the sequence \((a_n)\) is convergent so we can have \(|a_n - l|\) be less than any \(\epsilon\) we like as long as \(n &gt; N\). Here we can see that choosing \(\epsilon/2\) will get us to \(\epsilon\) like we want to.
<br /> 
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \((a_n)\) be a convergent sequence. Let \((a_n) \rightarrow l\). This means that for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), there must exist a number \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - l| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} \quad \text{whenever $n &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To prove that \((a_n)\) is cauchy, we need to prove that for \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) and for \(n, m &gt; N\), then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_m - a_n| &lt; \epsilon \quad \text{whenever $n, m &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To see this, consider \(|a_m - a_n|\). Add and subtract the limit \(l\) and then use triangle inequality to achieve the following</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_m - a_n| &amp;= |a_m - l + l - a_n| \\
	&amp;\leq |a_m - l| + |l - a_n|.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>But now we know that \((a_n)\) converges to \(l\). We have already established the bound \(|a_n - l| &lt; \epsilon/2\) earlier so for \(n, m &gt; N\),</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_m - a_n| &amp;\leq |a_m - l| + |l - a_n| \\
	&amp;&lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>From this we see that \((a_n)\) is a Cauchy sequence as we wanted to show. \(\blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \((a_n)\) be a cauchy sequence and let \(\epsilon = 1\). By definition, this means that there exists a number \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - a_m| &lt; 1 \quad \text{whenever $m, n &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Fix \(a_m\) such that \(m = N+1\). Since \(N+1 &gt; N\), then the following holds</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - a_{N+1}| \leq 1 \quad \text{whenever $n &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Now we can expand the above inequality to</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	-1 \leq a_n - a_{N+1} &amp;\leq 1 \\
	a_{N+1} - 1 \leq a_n &amp;\leq 1 + a_{N+1}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>From this, we can see that we have established a bound on all the terms of the sequence starting after the \(N\)th term. For earlier terms, we can establish a bound by defining the lower and upper bounds as</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	L = \min\{a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_N, a_{N+1}-1\}, \\
	U = \min\{a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_N, a_{N+1}+1\}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(L\) is a lower bound on any term that comes on or before the \(N\)th term and similarly \(U\) is an upper bound on all the terms that comes on or before the \(N\)th. Therefore \((a_n)\) is bounded. \(\blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Problem Discussion</b></h4>
<p>We’ll follow a similar approach to proving the example in <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/04/analysis-seq-sqrt.html">here</a>. We want to show that \((\sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n})\) converges to 0, so we need to find \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\),</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} - 0 \rvert &lt; \epsilon \quad \text{whenever $n &gt; N$}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>since \(\sqrt{n + 1} &gt; \sqrt{n}\), we can drop the absolute value and then we’ll use the trick of multiplying by the conjugate.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} \rvert &amp;&lt; \epsilon \\
\left(\frac{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}}\right) \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} &amp;&lt; \epsilon \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}} &amp;&lt; \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We need to remember here that we’re trying to find an \(n\) that would make the above inequality true. So we want to solve for \(n\). but it’s not easy since we have \(\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}\) in the denominator. What can we do to simplify this? The goal here is that want to keep this term under \(\epsilon\) so instead of focusing on the term itself, we could maybe find a slightly bigger term that is easier to work with. For example we can simplify the bound to:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}} &amp;&lt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{n} + \sqrt{n}} \\
&amp;&lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>\((\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}})\) is slightly bigger than the original term and so we’re getting an even bigger term to be less than \(\epsilon\) so this definitely works.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}} &amp;&lt; \epsilon \\
\frac{1}{2\epsilon} &amp;&lt; \sqrt{n} \\
\sqrt{n} &amp;&gt; \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \\
n &amp;&gt; \frac{1}{4\epsilon^2}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So now if we let \(n\) be greater than \(N = \frac{1}{4\epsilon^2}\), we’ll get the bound that we want \(\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} \rvert &lt; \epsilon\). In the formal proof, we’ll have to walk backwards.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Formal Proof</b></h4>
<p>To show that \((\sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n})\) converges to 0, let \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) be arbitrary. We want to prove that there exists some \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that when \(n &gt; N\),</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} - 0\rvert &lt; \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Pick \(N = \frac{1}{4\epsilon^2}\). We now verify that this choice is appropriate. Let \(n &gt; N\). Then,</p>

<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} \rvert \\
\left(\frac{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}}\right) \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}} &amp;&lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>But we know since \(n &gt; N\) then \(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}} &lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{N}}\) and so</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}} &lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{N}} &amp;&lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\frac{1}{4\epsilon^2}}} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\frac{2}{2\epsilon}} \\
&amp;= \epsilon. \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>and we \(\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} \rvert \leq \epsilon\) as desired. \(\blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Problem Discussion:</b></h4>
<p>This is a great theorem because we’re saying that given any sequence whether convergent or divergent, we can still extract a convergent subsequence from it. For example if we’re given the sequence \(\{0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,.....\}\) which clearly won’t converge, we can still make up the subsequence \(\{0,0,0,0,....\}\) which clearly converges to 0. But how do we prove this? This proof relies on the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/04/30/analysis-nested-internval-property.html">nested interval property</a> which states that the intersection a nested sequence of closed intervals is non-empty. We will construct a subsequence from having many nested intervals and then we’ll use the nested sequence property to conclude something about its convergence.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \((a_n)\) be a bounded sequence. By <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/03/analysis-seq-bounded.html">theorem 2.3.1</a>, we know that there exists a number \(M &gt; 0\) satisfying \(|a_n| \leq M\) for all \(n \in \mathbf{N}\). We will bisect this closed interval \([-M,M]\) into two closed intervals \([-M,0]\) and \([0,M]\) noting here that the mid point belongs to both intervals. Now, \((a_n)\) has infinitely many terms by definition. So one of these halfs must contain an infinite number of terms of the sequence \((a_n)\). Let this interval be \(I_1\) (Choose the left half if both had infinitely many terms).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/real-analysis/bolzano-0.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Now, we’re construct a subsequence from \((a_n)\). The first term \(a_{n_1}\) will an arbitrary element chosen from \(I_1\) so \(a_n \in I_1\). Bisect \(I_1\) again into two intervals and let \(I_2\) be the interval containing infinite terms (there should be at least one).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/real-analysis/bolzano-1.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Let \(a_{n_2}\) be chosen from \(I_2\) such that \(n_2 &gt; n_1\) (Side Note: Remember that \(n_2\) indicates the positon of the element in the subsequence. We can choose \(n_2\) to be bigger than \(n_1\) because \(I_2\) has infinitely many terms so even if \(a_{n_1}\) was really big like \(a_{3435453...}\), we can still find a bigger subscript since there are infinitely many terms. Moreover, our sequence is not monotone so we don’t need to worry about picking an element from the right half before the left half. This doesn’t matter. We only care about respecting the order of the elements in the sequence). 
<br />
<br />
Next, we’re going to bisect \(I_2\) in the same way and choose \(I_3\) to be the half with infinitely many terms.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/real-analysis/bolzano-2.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>In general, we will construct the closed interval \(I_k\) by taking the half of interval \(I_{k-1}\) that contains infinitely many terms. We will then construct a subsequence \((a_{n_k})\) such that \(a_k \in I_k\) and</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
n_k &gt; n_{k-1} &gt; ... &gt; n_2 &gt; n_1.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Now, we want to prove that \((a_{n_k})\) is a convergent subsequence. To do so, we need to find a candidate for limit. We do know by construction that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq I_3 \supseteq ...
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This forms a nested sequence of closed intervals and so by the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/04/30/analysis-nested-internval-property.html">Nested Interval Property</a>, there exits at least one point \(x \in \mathbf{R}\) such that it is contained in every interval \(I_k\). So let’s prove that \((a_{n_k}) \rightarrow x\).
<br />
<br />
Let \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) be arbitrary chosen. We will show that there exists a number \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that for any \(k \geq N\), we have</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_{n_k} - x| \leq \epsilon.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To see this, we know by construction that the length of interval \(I_k\) is \(M(1/2)^{k-1}\). But we also know that \((M(1/2)^{k-1}) \rightarrow 0\) (TODO: link). This means that the intervals are getting smaller and smaller until the length of these intervals converges to 0. So in this case, just choose \(N\) such that when \(k \geq N\), the length of interval \(I_k\) is less than \(\epsilon\). Even though we chose the intervals to have length less than \(\epsilon\), we still have \(a_{n_k} \in I_k\) by construction and we still have \(x \in I_k\) by the Nested Interval Property. But since the interval length is less than \(\epsilon\), then the distance between \(a_{n_k}\) and \(x\) must be less than \(\epsilon\) or in other words \(|a_{n_k} - x| \leq \epsilon\) as wanted to show. Therefore, \((a_{n_k}) \rightarrow x\). \(\blacksquare\)

For the absolute value function definition and other properties see here. For the definitions of sequences, subsequences and what it means to for a sequence to converge, see this. For the “show the limit” template and an example, see this. Problem Discussion: This is a great theorem because we’re saying that given any sequence whether convergent or divergent, we can still extract a convergent subsequence from it. For example if we’re given the sequence \(\{0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,.....\}\) which clearly won’t converge, we can still make up the subsequence \(\{0,0,0,0,....\}\) which clearly converges to 0. But how do we prove this? This proof relies on the nested interval property which states that the intersection a nested sequence of closed intervals is non-empty. We will construct a subsequence from having many nested intervals and then we’ll use the nested sequence property to conclude something about its convergence. Proof: Let \((a_n)\) be a bounded sequence. By theorem 2.3.1, we know that there exists a number \(M &gt; 0\) satisfying \(|a_n| \leq M\) for all \(n \in \mathbf{N}\). We will bisect this closed interval \([-M,M]\) into two closed intervals \([-M,0]\) and \([0,M]\) noting here that the mid point belongs to both intervals. Now, \((a_n)\) has infinitely many terms by definition. So one of these halfs must contain an infinite number of terms of the sequence \((a_n)\). Let this interval be \(I_1\) (Choose the left half if both had infinitely many terms).]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Convergence of Subsequences: Example</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/13/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence-example.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Convergence of Subsequences: Example" /><published>2024-06-13T01:01:36-07:00</published><updated>2024-06-13T01:01:36-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/13/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence-example</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/13/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence-example.html"><![CDATA[<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">

<h4><b>Problem Discussion:</b></h4>
<p>This was really tricky. We are given a sequence and to find its limit, the idea here is to extract a subsequence and then concluding that it also converges to the same limit as the original sequence by theorem 2.5.2 which says that subsequences of a convergent sequence converge to the same limit as the original sequence. But then we can also find the limit of the subsequence using a differen path. So’ll end up with two limits for the same subsequence. This is impossible since limits are unique and this will give us a direct us. This final answer is only the limit of the subsequence but also the limit of the sequence itself.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \((b^n)\) is the sequence defined above. This sequence is decreasing and bounded below by definition. By the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/04/29/analysis-seq-monotone-convergence-theorem.html">monotone convergence theorem</a>, \((b^n)\) convergences to some number \(l\) such that \(b &gt; l \geq 0\). To compute \(l\), let \((b^{2n})\) be a subsequence of \((b^n)\). The terms of \((b^{2n})\) are</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
b^2 &gt; b^4 &gt; b^6 &gt; ... &gt; 0.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Since \((b^{2n})\) is a subsequence of \((b^n)\), then by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/11/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence.html">theorem 2.5.2</a>, we must have that \((b^{2n}) \rightarrow l\). 
<br /><br />
But, note that \(b^{2n} = b^nb^n\). So we can use the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/01/analysis-seq-algebraic-limit-theorem-iii.html">algebraic limit theorem</a> to conclude that \((b^{2n}) \rightarrow l*l = l^2\). So now we arrived at two results. First \((b^{2n}) \rightarrow l\) and now \((b^{2n}) \rightarrow l^2\). But we know that the limit of a sequence is unique from <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/04/27/analysis-seq-limits-unique.html">uniqueness of limits theorem (2.2.7)</a>, so we must have that \(l^2 = l\) and therefore \(l = 0\).</p>
