1.5 Exercise 21
</div>
<div class="ybdiv">
Let \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) be disjoint linearly independent subsets of \(V\). Prove that \(S_1 \cup S_2\) is linearly dependent if and only if \(span(S_1) \cap span(S_2) \neq \{0\}\). 
</div>
<br>
Proof:
<br>
$$\Rightarrow$$: Since $$S_1 \cup S_2$$ is linearly dependent, then there exists vectors $$u_1,u_2,...,u_n$$ in $$S_1$$, the vectors $$w_1,w_2,...,w_m$$ in $$S_2$$ and not all zero scalars $$a_1,...a_n,b_1,...,b_m$$ such that
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	a_1u_1 + a_2u_2 + ... + a_nu_n + b_1w_1 + b_2w_2 + ... + b_nw_m &= \bar{0}. \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
Re-arranging the terms
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	a_1u_1 + a_2u_2 + ... + a_nu_n &= - (b_1w_1 + b_2w_2 + ... + b_nw_m).
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
Let $$w = a_1u_1 + a_2u_2 + ... + a_nu_n = - (b_1w_1 + b_2w_2 + ... + b_nw_m)$$. We claim that $$w$$ is a non-zero vector. Why? suppose for the sake of contradiction that it was the zero vector. We said earlier that not all the scalars are zero. This is a contradiction because $$S_1$$ and $$S_2$$ are linearly independent. This means that the solution to $$a_1u_1 + a_2u_2 + ... + a_nu_n = - (b_1w_1 + b_2w_2 + ... + b_nw_m) = \bar{0}$$ must only be the trivial solution where all the scalars are zero. Therefore we must have $$w$$ be a non-zero vector.
<br>
<br>
Futhermore, $$w = (a_1u_1 + a_2u_2 + ... + a_nu_n)$$ is a linear combination of the elements in $$S_1$$ and so it's a vector in $$Span(S_1)$$ by the defintion of the span of a set. Similarly, $$w = - (b_1w_1 + b_2w_2 + ... + b_nw_m)$$ is a vector in $$Span(S_2)$$. From this, we see that $$w$$ is in both the span of $$S_1$$ and $$S_2$$ and so $$w \in Span(S_1) \cap Span(S_2)$$.
<br>
<br>
$$\Leftarrow$$: Suppose now that $$span(S_1) \cap span(S_2) \neq \{\bar{0}\}$$. Let $$v$$ be a non-zero vector in both $$Span(S_1)$$ and $$Span(S_2)$$. This means we can write $$v$$ a linear combination of the elements of $$S_1$$,
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	v = a_1u_1 + a_2u_2 + ... + a_nu_n.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
And we can also write $$v$$ as a linear combination of the elements in $$S_2$$ as follows,
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	v = b_1w_1 + b_2w_2 + ... + b_nw_m.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
From this we see that,
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	&a_1u_1 + a_2u_2 + ... + a_nu_n = b_1w_1 + b_2w_2 + ... + b_nw_m. \\
	&a_1u_1 + a_2u_2 + ... + a_nu_n - (b_1w_1 + b_2w_2 + ... + b_nw_m) = \bar{0}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
Since $$v$$ is non-zero and both $$S_1$$ and $$S_2$$ are linearly independent, then all of these scalars are non-zero and so this means that $$S_1 \cup S_2$$ is linearly dependent by the definition of linear dependence. $$\blacksquare$$
