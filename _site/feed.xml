  (3.2.5) A point \(x\) is a limit point of a set \(A\) if and only if \(x = \lim a_n\) for some sequence \(a_n\) contained in \(A\) satisfying \(a_n \neq x\) for all \(n \in \mathbf{N}\).
</div>
<p><br />
So “\(x\) is a limit point of \(A\)” means that \(x\) is the limit of a sequence in \(A\). The only thing we don’t want is to have any term of that sequence be \(x\) itself. The reason for this is then every member of the set could potentially be a limit point since we can create the sequence \(\{x,x,x,x,x,...\}\) and we don’t want that.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>\(\Rightarrow\): Assume that \(x\) is a limit point of \(A\) and so for every \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), the intersection of \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\) with the set \(A\) is nonempty and has an element that is not \(x\). We then want to prove that there is a sequence of points \(a_1, a_2, a_3, ...\) from \(A/\{x\}\) such that \((a_n) \rightarrow x\). Now for each \(n \in \mathbf{N}\), pick a point</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a_n \in V_{1/n}(x) \cap A,
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This means that the first element in the sequence is in \(V_1(x)\), the second element is in \(V_{1/2}(x)\). The third element is in \(V_{1/3}(x)\) and so on (We are basically getting closer and closer to \(x\)). This sequence \((a_n)\) coverages to \(x\). To see why, let \(\epsilon &gt; 0\). We can choose \(N\) such that \(N &gt; \frac{1}{\epsilon}\). So now for any \(n &gt; N\),</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|a_n - x| &amp;&lt; \frac{1}{n} \quad \text{ All the elements in $V_{1/n}$ must be within $1/n$ at most from $x$}\\
&amp;&lt; \frac{1}{N} \\
&amp;&lt; \frac{1}{1/\epsilon} = \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>

<p><br />
<br />
\(\Leftarrow\): Assume that \((a_n) \rightarrow x\) where \(a_n \in A\) and \(a_n \neq x\). Let \(V_{\epsilon}\) be arbitrary. We want to prove that there some element from \((a_n)\) in that neighborhood \(V_{\epsilon}\). But since \((a_n) \rightarrow x\), then we know that there exists an \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that if \(n \geq N\), we must have \(|a_n - x| \leq \epsilon\). Therefore, for any \(n \geq N\), we know that we have \(a_n \in V_{\epsilon}\).</p>

<p>\(\blacksquare\).

</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>Let \(\{O_{}: \lambda \in \Lambda\}\) be a collection of open sets and let \(O = \bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda}O_{\lambda}\). Let \(a\) be an arbitrary element of \(O\). To show that \(O\) is open, we need to produce an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood of \(a\) that is contained in \(O\). Since \(a \in O\), then \(a\) must be in at least one particular set \(O_{\lambda'}\). But we know that \(O_{\lambda'}\) is open and so there must exists a neighborhood \(V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq O_{\lambda'}\). But since \(O_{\lambda'} \subseteq O\), then \(V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq O\) as we wanted to show.
<br />
<br />
For (ii), let \(\{O_1, O_2, ..., O_N\}\) be a finite collection of open sets. We know that \(a \in \bigcap_{k=1}^{N} O_k\). This means that there exists  \(V_{\epsilon_k}(a) \subseteq O_{k}\). But since this is an intersection, the trick is to take the smallest one and therefore let \(\epsilon = min\{\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, ..., \epsilon_N\}\). Since \(V_{\epsilon}(a)\) is the smallest one now, then we know \(V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq V_{\epsilon_k}(a)\) for all \(k\) and so \(V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq \bigcap_{k=1}^{N} O_k\) as we wanted to show. \(\blacksquare\).

Set \(\epsilon = \min\{x - c, d - x\}\), then from this we see that \(V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq (c,d)\).

Therefore, \((a_n)\) must diverge as required. \(\blacksquare\) References: Wrath of Math Youtube Channel]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A sequence converges to a if and only if every subsequence of it also converges to a</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/19/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A sequence converges to a if and only if every subsequence of it also converges to a" /><published>2024-06-19T01:01:36-07:00</published><updated>2024-06-19T01:01:36-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/19/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/19/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence.html"><![CDATA[<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">

<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \((a_n)\) be a sequence. The statement, if a sequence \(a_n\) converges to \(a\) then every subsequence also converges to \(a\), is proved in <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/11/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence.html">here</a>. We now prove the other direction that claims that if every subsequence converges to \(a\) then \((a_n)\) also converges to \(a\). Assume that every subsequence of \((a_n)\) converges to \(a\). But \((a_n)\) is also a subsequence of itself. Take \((a_{n_k})\) and set \(n_k = k\). so \(n_1\) is the first term of the sequence, \(n_2\) is the second term of the sequence and so on. Therefore, \((a_n)\) also converges to \(a\). \(\blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Discussion:</b></h4>
<p>We already did the direction every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence in <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/17/analysis-seq-convergent-sequences-are-cauchy.html">here</a>. For the second part where we want to prove that a Cauchy sequence converges, we want to find \(N\) such that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - l| \leq \epsilon \quad \text{whenever $n &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>But we don’t know what \(l\) is. How can we come up with such a candidate?? the trick is to use other theorems to get us there. In particular this proof uses the fact that every Cauchy sequence is bounded and then uses the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem to conclude that there must exist a subsequence that is convergent from the original sequence. This limit is a good candidate because we also proved earlier that subsequences converge to the same limit as the original sequence in <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/11/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence.html">here</a>)
<br />
<br />
So now we can go back and figure out what \(N\) would work here. We have \(|a_n - l|\). We can do the same exact trick of adding and subtracting the same term and then using the triangle inequality to come up with good candidate.
<br /> 
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>The direction, a convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence is proved <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/17/analysis-seq-convergent-sequences-are-cauchy.html">here</a>. For the other direction, we want to prove that if a sequence is Cauchy then it is convergent. Let \((a_n)\) be a Cauchy sequence. This means that \((a_n)\) is bounded by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/16/analysis-seq-cauchy-bounded.html">the proof we did earlier</a>. And since \((a_n)\) is bounded, then by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/14/analysis-seq-subseq-bolzano-weierstrass-theorem.html">the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem</a>, we know that we must have a subsequence that is convergent. Let this subsequence be \((a_{n_k})\) and let \((a_{n_k}) \rightarrow l\). We will use \(l\) as the convergence candidate for \((a_n)\).
<br />
<br />
Since \((a_n)\) is Cauchy, then there exists \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - a_m| \leq \frac{\epsilon}{2} \quad \text{whenever $n, m &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We also know that \((a_{n_k}) \rightarrow l\). Let \(a_{n_K}\) be a term from the subsequence \((a_{n_k})\) such that \(n_K &gt; N\). Therefore, the following holds</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_{n_K} - l| \leq \frac{\epsilon}{2} \quad \text{whenever $n_K &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To prove that \((a_n) \rightarrow l\), we’ll prove that \(|a_n - l| \leq \epsilon\) whenever \(n &gt; N\). To see that, we’ll add and subtract \(a_{n_K}\) and then use the triangular inequality to bound the term,</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - l| &amp;= |a_n + a_{n_K} - a_{n_K} - l| \\
	          &amp;\leq |a_n - a_{n_K}| + |a_{n_K} - l| \\
			  &amp;&lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Therefore, \((a_n)\) converges to \(l\) as we wanted to show. \(\blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Discussion:</b></h4>
<p>We want to find \(N\) such that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_m - a_n| &lt; \epsilon \quad \text{whenever $n, m &gt; N$}.

</div>
<p>If we start with \(|a_m - a_n|\) then we can use the trick of adding and subtracting the limit inside the absolute value. We do this because we are hoping to use the triangle inequality to bound the term \(|a_m - a_n|\) so</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_m - a_n| &amp;= |a_m - l + l - a_n| \\
	&amp;\leq |a_m - l| + |l - a_n|.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Our goal is to bound the term to be less than \(\epsilon\) and now we have \(|a_m - l|\) and \(|l - a_n|\). But we already know that the sequence \((a_n)\) is convergent so we can have \(|a_n - l|\) be less than any \(\epsilon\) we like as long as \(n &gt; N\). Here we can see that choosing \(\epsilon/2\) will get us to \(\epsilon\) like we want to.
<br /> 
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \((a_n)\) be a convergent sequence. Let \((a_n) \rightarrow l\). This means that for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), there must exist a number \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - l| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} \quad \text{whenever $n &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To prove that \((a_n)\) is cauchy, we need to prove that for \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) and for \(n, m &gt; N\), then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_m - a_n| &lt; \epsilon \quad \text{whenever $n, m &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To see this, consider \(|a_m - a_n|\). Add and subtract the limit \(l\) and then use triangle inequality to achieve the following</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_m - a_n| &amp;= |a_m - l + l - a_n| \\
	&amp;\leq |a_m - l| + |l - a_n|.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>But now we know that \((a_n)\) converges to \(l\). We have already established the bound \(|a_n - l| &lt; \epsilon/2\) earlier so for \(n, m &gt; N\),</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_m - a_n| &amp;\leq |a_m - l| + |l - a_n| \\
	&amp;&lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>From this we see that \((a_n)\) is a Cauchy sequence as we wanted to show. \(\blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \((a_n)\) be a cauchy sequence and let \(\epsilon = 1\). By definition, this means that there exists a number \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - a_m| &lt; 1 \quad \text{whenever $m, n &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Fix \(a_m\) such that \(m = N+1\). Since \(N+1 &gt; N\), then the following holds</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_n - a_{N+1}| \leq 1 \quad \text{whenever $n &gt; N$}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Now we can expand the above inequality to</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	-1 \leq a_n - a_{N+1} &amp;\leq 1 \\
	a_{N+1} - 1 \leq a_n &amp;\leq 1 + a_{N+1}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>From this, we can see that we have established a bound on all the terms of the sequence starting after the \(N\)th term. For earlier terms, we can establish a bound by defining the lower and upper bounds as</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	L = \min\{a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_N, a_{N+1}-1\}, \\
	U = \min\{a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_N, a_{N+1}+1\}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(L\) is a lower bound on any term that comes on or before the \(N\)th term and similarly \(U\) is an upper bound on all the terms that comes on or before the \(N\)th. Therefore \((a_n)\) is bounded. \(\blacksquare\)

For earlier terms, we can establish a bound by defining the lower and upper bounds as $$ \begin{align*} L = \min\{a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_N, a_{N+1}-1\}, \\ U = \min\{a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_N, a_{N+1}+1\}. \end{align*} $$ \(L\) is a lower bound on any term that comes on or before the \(N\)th term and similarly \(U\) is an upper bound on all the terms that comes on or before the \(N\)th. Therefore \((a_n)\) is bounded. \(\blacksquare\) References: Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott Wrath of Math Youtube Channel]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Sequence Convergence Example 3</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/15/analysis-seq-sqrt-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sequence Convergence Example 3" /><published>2024-06-15T01:01:36-07:00</published><updated>2024-06-15T01:01:36-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/15/analysis-seq-sqrt-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/15/analysis-seq-sqrt-2.html"><![CDATA[<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">

<h4><b>Problem Discussion</b></h4>
<p>We’ll follow a similar approach to proving the example in <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/04/analysis-seq-sqrt.html">here</a>. We want to show that \((\sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n})\) converges to 0, so we need to find \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\),</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} - 0 \rvert &lt; \epsilon \quad \text{whenever $n &gt; N$}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>since \(\sqrt{n + 1} &gt; \sqrt{n}\), we can drop the absolute value and then we’ll use the trick of multiplying by the conjugate.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} \rvert &amp;&lt; \epsilon \\
\left(\frac{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}}\right) \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} &amp;&lt; \epsilon \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}} &amp;&lt; \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We need to remember here that we’re trying to find an \(n\) that would make the above inequality true. So we want to solve for \(n\). but it’s not easy since we have \(\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}\) in the denominator. What can we do to simplify this? The goal here is that want to keep this term under \(\epsilon\) so instead of focusing on the term itself, we could maybe find a slightly bigger term that is easier to work with. For example we can simplify the bound to:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}} &amp;&lt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{n} + \sqrt{n}} \\
&amp;&lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>\((\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}})\) is slightly bigger than the original term and so we’re getting an even bigger term to be less than \(\epsilon\) so this definitely works.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}} &amp;&lt; \epsilon \\
\frac{1}{2\epsilon} &amp;&lt; \sqrt{n} \\
\sqrt{n} &amp;&gt; \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \\
n &amp;&gt; \frac{1}{4\epsilon^2}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So now if we let \(n\) be greater than \(N = \frac{1}{4\epsilon^2}\), we’ll get the bound that we want \(\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} \rvert &lt; \epsilon\). In the formal proof, we’ll have to walk backwards.

<h4><b>Formal Proof</b></h4>
<p>To show that \((\sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n})\) converges to 0, let \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) be arbitrary. We want to prove that there exists some \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that when \(n &gt; N\),</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} - 0\rvert &lt; \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Pick \(N = \frac{1}{4\epsilon^2}\). We now verify that this choice is appropriate. Let \(n &gt; N\). Then,</p>

<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} \rvert \\
\left(\frac{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}}\right) \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}} &amp;&lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>But we know since \(n &gt; N\) then \(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}} &lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{N}}\) and so</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}} &lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{N}} &amp;&lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\frac{1}{4\epsilon^2}}} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\frac{2}{2\epsilon}} \\
&amp;= \epsilon. \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>and we \(\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} \rvert \leq \epsilon\) as desired. \(\blacksquare\)
