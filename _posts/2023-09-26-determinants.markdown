This post is just me taking notes while watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">Essence of Linear Algebra by 3Blue1Brown</a> which is the best reference on Linear Algebra ever. I might add other notes from other places as I go.

<h4><b>Linear Transformations Recap</b></h4>

We've talked about linear transformations previously. Some squish the space and some strech the space (while of course keeping the grid lines parallel and evenly spaced and the origin in the same place). How can we measure the amount of streching? Given an the area bounded by some region before applying the transformation, how much did it grow by?
