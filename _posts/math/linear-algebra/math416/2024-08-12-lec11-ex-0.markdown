Problem 4
</div>
<div class="ybdiv">
Let \(V\) and \(W\) be finite dimensional vector spaces and \(T: V \rightarrow W\) be linear.
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>Prove that if \(\dim(V) < \dim (W)\), then \(T\) cannot be onto.</li>
	<li>Prove that if \(\dim(W) < \dim(V)\), then \(T\) cannot be one-to-one.</li>
</ol>
</div>
Proof:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(T\) was onto. This means that \(Rank(T) = \dim(W)\). The dimension theorem states that
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		\dim(V) &= Nullity(T) + Rank(T) \\
		       &= Nullity(T) + \dim(W)
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
This implies that \(Nullity(T) = \dim(V) - \dim(W) < 0\) since \(\dim(V) < \dim(W)\). This is a contradiction and so \(T\) cannot be onto. \(\blacksquare\)  
	</li>
	<li>Similarly, suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(T\) is one-to-one. This means that \(Nullity(T) = 0\) and so by the dimension theorem, it must be that \(\dim(V) = \dim(W)\). But this is a contradiction since \(\dim(W) < \dim(V)\).</li> </ol>
