<h4><b>Let \(A \in \mathbf{R}\) be nonempty and bounded above. Let \(c \in \mathbf{R}\). Define the set \(A + c\) by \(c + A = \{ c + a: a \in A\}\). Then \(sup(c+A) = c + sup A\).</b></h4>
<p>What is this statement saying? Let’s recall the definition of set being bounded above and also a least upper bound:</p>

<p>A set \(A \in \mathbf{R}\) is bounded above if there exists a number \(b \in \mathbf{R}\) such that</p>

<p><br />
<br />
 First, it is important to remember that a set bounded above is a necessary condition to have a least upper bound. Without this condition we might not have a least upper bound. Second also remember that the least upper bound doesn’t need to be in the set \(A\). Unlike the maximum and minimum of sets where they must be in the set itself. 
<br /><br />
So now suppose we have a least upper bound \(sup(A)\) and suppose we add a constant to every element in the set \(A\), then the least upper bound is \(sup(A)+c\). My question here that might get answered later: Why does \(c\) need to be added to every single element. Will will get the same result if we only add \(c\) to a single element in \(A\). I think the result will still apply?</p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>We’ll prove both directions of the statement since we have an “if and only if”.</p>
<ul>
	<li>\((\Rightarrow)\) If \(a\) and \(b\) are equal then for every real number \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) we'll have \(|a - b| &lt; \epsilon\). </li>
So we're given that \(a\) and \(b\) are equal. This means that the distance between \(a\) and \(b\) is zero. In other words, \(|a-b| = 0\). Therefore, no matter what \(epsilon\) we choose, we'll always have \(\epsilon &gt; |a-b|\) as required.
<br /><br />
	<li>\((\Leftarrow)\) If it's the case that for every real number \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) we have \(|a - b| &lt; \epsilon\), then \(|a = b\)</li>
Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(a \neq b\). This means that the distance between \(a\) and \(b\) is greater than zero and so \(|a - b| &gt; 0\). Let this distance be \(d\) so we have \(d = |a - b|\). We know our assumption states that for every real number \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) we have \(|a - b| &lt; \epsilon\) so no matter what \(\epsilon\) we chooses, we're guaranteed that \(|a - b| &lt; \epsilon\). But what if we choose \(\epsilon = d\). The assumption states that we must have \(|a - b| &lt; d\) but then earlier we said that \(d = |a - b|\). This is a contradiction and so \(a\) and \(b\) must be equal.
</ul>

<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Axiom of Completeness</b></h4>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h4><b>Upper and Lower Bounds</b></h4>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A set \(A \in \mathbf{R}\) is bounded above if there exists a number \(b \in \mathbf{R}\) such that \(a \leq b\) for \(a \in A\). The number \(b\) is an upper bound for \(A\). Similarly, the set \(A\) is bounded below if there exists a lower bound \(l \in \mathbf{R}\) satisfying \(l \leq a\) for every \(a \in A\).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Note here that \(b\) doesn’t need to be \(A\). A set like \(\{1,2\}\) can have an upper bound like 3 for example. Every element in this set is less than 3. Also note here that \(A\) and \(b\) are both in \(\mathbf{R}\). 
<br /><br />
Questions: What if we don’t find such a \(b\)? can we conclude that the set is infinite?
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Least Upper and Greater Lower Bounds</b></h4>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A real number \(s\) is the least upper bound for a set \(A \in \mathbf{R}\) if it meets the following two criteria:<br />(i) \(s\) is an upper bound for A; <br />(ii) if \(b\) is any upper bound for \(A\), then \(s \leq b\).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The least upper bound is also called the supremum of the set \(A\) or \(\sup A\) while the greatest lower bound is called the infimum or \(\inf A\). Both bounds are unique. There can only be least upper bound and one greatest lower bound. 
<br /><br />
Questions: since \(s\) must be an upper bound, does it mean that the set \(A\) is a bounded set?
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Minimum and Maximum</b></h4>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A real number \(a_0\) is a maximum of the set \(A\) if \(a_0\) is an element of \(A\) and \(a_0 \geq a\) for all \(a \in A\). Similarly a real number \(a_1\) is a minimum \(a_1\) is a minimum of the set \(A\) if \(a_1 \in A\) and \(a_1 \leq a\) for all \(a \in A\).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>It’s definitely clear here that the maximum and minimum must be elements of the set itself unlike the upper and lower bounds.

<br /></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Suppose it is a rational number and let \(\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are integers and \(q\) is not zero. Furthermore, assume that the fraction is in its simplist form. If it’s not then simplify it until you can’t simplify further. Now we can square each side:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
(\sqrt{2})^2 &amp;= \big(\frac{p}{q}\big)^2 \\
2 &amp;= \frac{p^2}{q^2} \\
p^2 &amp;= 2q^2. \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>From this we can conclude that \(p^2\) is even since it’s a multiple of 2. Since \(p^2\) is even, then \(p\) must be even as well. Why? Suppose it wasn’t even and that \(p\) is was an odd number. Since \(p\) is odd, let \(p = 2k+1\) where \(k\) is an integer. Now, square \(p\) so that we have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
p^2 &amp;= (2k+1)^2 \\
&amp;= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \\
&amp;= 2(2k^2+2k) + 1.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>\(2k^2 + 2k\) is an integer and so \(p^2\) has the form of an odd number so it’s odd! But this is a contradiction since we established earlier that \(p^2\) is even. Therefore, \(p\) can’t be odd and has to be even. Since \(p\) is even, we can write \(p\) as \(2r\) where \(r\) is an integer. Let’s plug in \(2r\) back in \(p^2 = 2q^2\) and simplify,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
p^2 &amp;= 2q^2 \\
(2r)^2 &amp;= 2q^2 \\
4r^2 &amp;= 2q^2 \\
2r^2 &amp;= q^2.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>But now \(q^2\) is even since it’s a multiple of 2! Since \(p^2\) is even and \(q^2\) is also even then they must have at least 2 as a common factor. But we said earlier that \(p^2/q^2\) is in its simplest form. Therefore, this is a contradiction and \(\sqrt{2}\) can not be a rational number!

Suppose we’re given:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{5x - 2}{3x + 9}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>The easiest way to see what happens to \(f\) when \(x\) approaches \(\infty\) is to always divide both the numerator and the denominator by the largest power in the denominator. So for the above example, we’ll see:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{5x - 2}{3x + 9} = \frac{5 - \frac{2}{x}}{3 + \frac{9}{x}}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Notice here that both fractions \(2/x\) and \(9/x\) will become zero as \(x\) approaches infinity. They will both become really small as \(x\) increases. So now if we evaluate this limit we’ll see that it evaluates to the following</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{5 - \frac{2}{x}}{3 + \frac{9}{x}} = \frac{5 - 0}{3 + 0} = \frac{5}{3}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This is such as easy way to clearly see where the limit is going. But why do we not divide by the highest power of the numerator for example? This is because if we have something \(5x^2 / x + 3\) then dividing by \(x^2\) will give us \(5 / 1/x + 3\). The denominator is now reaching 0! and that is not helpful as it makes the whole thing undefined.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Suppose we want to find what this function approaches as \(x\) approaches \(infinity\):</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{7x^3 - 2x^2 + 1}{9 - 2x}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Let’s start by dividing by the highest power of the denominator and see what we get.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{7x^2 - 2x^1 + \frac{1}{x}}{\frac{9}{x} - 2}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>You see now how the denominator will just approach -2 since \(9/x\) will be zero. The numerator on the other hand will approach positive infinity making the whole function approach negative infinity at the end!</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{7x^2 - 2x^1 + \frac{1}{x}}{\frac{9}{x} - 2} = \frac{+\infty}{-2} = -\infty
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Another Example</b></h4>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to\infty} \sqrt[3]{ \frac{7x^3 - 2x^2 + 1}{9 - 2x} }
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We can take the cubic root outside and then divide by the highest power which is \(x^2\).</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to\infty} \sqrt[3]{ \frac{2x^2 - 3}{3x^2 - 5} } &amp;= \sqrt[3]{ \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{2x^2 - 3}{3x^2 - 5} } \\
&amp;= \sqrt[3]{ \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{2 - \frac{3}{x}}{3 - \frac{5}{x}} } \\
&amp;= \sqrt[3]{ \frac{2}{3} } 
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>One More Example</b></h4>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\sqrt{x^2+2}}{3x - 6}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This one is trickier. We want to divide by \(x\) but the problem is that we’ll end up with</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\frac{\sqrt{x^2+2}}{x}}{3 - \frac{6}{x}}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This isn’t particularly helpful since we can’t simplify the numerator. What we really want to divide by is \(\sqrt{x^2}\). This way we can move the x inside the square root. A neat trick to do that is to realize that \(|x| = \sqrt{x^2}\). So now we can do this:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\frac{\sqrt{x^2+2}}{\sqrt{x^2}}}{\frac{3x}{|x|} - \frac{6}{|x|}} = \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\sqrt{1+\frac{2}{x^2}}}{\frac{3x}{|x|} - \frac{6}{|x|}}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>What’s next? How do we simplify the absolute value? well this depends on where we’re going. We know that \(|x|\) is just a piecewise function such that \(|x|=\)</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
x \quad \text{ if \(x \geq 0\)} \\
-x \quad \text{ if \(x &lt; 0\)} \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>And we’re approaching positive infinity. This means we’re going to substitute \(x\) with really large positive values! so we can do this,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\frac{\sqrt{x^2+2}}{\sqrt{x^2}}}{\frac{3x}{|x|} - \frac{6}{|x|}} &amp; = \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\sqrt{1+\frac{2}{x^2}}}{\frac{3x}{x} - \frac{6}{x}} = \frac{\sqrt{1+0}}{3 - 0} = \frac{1}{3} 
\end{align*}
$$

Suppose we’re given: $$ \begin{align*} \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{5x - 2}{3x + 9} \end{align*} $$ The easiest way to see what happens to \(f\) when \(x\) approaches \(\infty\) is to always divide both the numerator and the denominator by the largest power in the denominator. So for the above example, we’ll see: $$ \begin{align*} \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{5x - 2}{3x + 9} = \frac{5 - \frac{2}{x}}{3 + \frac{9}{x}} \end{align*} $$ Notice here that both fractions \(2/x\) and \(9/x\) will become zero as \(x\) approaches infinity. They will both become really small as \(x\) increases. So now if we evaluate this limit we’ll see that it evaluates to the following $$ \begin{align*} \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{5 - \frac{2}{x}}{3 + \frac{9}{x}} = \frac{5 - 0}{3 + 0} = \frac{5}{3} \end{align*} $$ This is such as easy way to clearly see where the limit is going. But why do we not divide by the highest power of the numerator for example? This is because if we have something \(5x^2 / x + 3\) then dividing by \(x^2\) will give us \(5 / 1/x + 3\). The denominator is now reaching 0! and that is not helpful as it makes the whole thing undefined. Example Suppose we want to find what this function approaches as \(x\) approaches \(infinity\): $$ \begin{align*} \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{7x^3 - 2x^2 + 1}{9 - 2x} \end{align*} $$ Let’s start by dividing by the highest power of the denominator and see what we get. $$ \begin{align*} \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{7x^2 - 2x^1 + \frac{1}{x}}{\frac{9}{x} - 2} \end{align*} $$ You see now how the denominator will just approach -2 since \(9/x\) will be zero. The numerator on the other hand will approach positive infinity making the whole function approach negative infinity at the end! $$ \begin{align*} \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{7x^2 - 2x^1 + \frac{1}{x}}{\frac{9}{x} - 2} = \frac{+\infty}{-2} = -\infty \end{align*} $$ Another Example $$ \begin{align*} \lim_{x\to\infty} \sqrt[3]{ \frac{7x^3 - 2x^2 + 1}{9 - 2x} } \end{align*} $$ We can take the cubic root outside and then divide by the highest power which is \(x^2\). $$ \begin{align*} \lim_{x\to\infty} \sqrt[3]{ \frac{2x^2 - 3}{3x^2 - 5} } &amp;= \sqrt[3]{ \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{2x^2 - 3}{3x^2 - 5} } \\ &amp;= \sqrt[3]{ \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{2 - \frac{3}{x}}{3 - \frac{5}{x}} } \\ &amp;= \sqrt[3]{ \frac{2}{3} } \end{align*} $$ One More Example $$ \begin{align*} \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\sqrt{x^2+2}}{3x - 6} \end{align*} $$ This one is trickier. We want to divide by \(x\) but the problem is that we’ll end up with $$ \begin{align*} \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\frac{\sqrt{x^2+2}}{x}}{3 - \frac{6}{x}} \end{align*} $$ This isn’t particularly helpful since we can’t simplify the numerator. What we really want to divide by is \(\sqrt{x^2}\). This way we can move the x inside the square root. A neat trick to do that is to realize that \(|x| = \sqrt{x^2}\). So now we can do this: $$ \begin{align*} \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\frac{\sqrt{x^2+2}}{\sqrt{x^2}}}{\frac{3x}{|x|} - \frac{6}{|x|}} = \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\sqrt{1+\frac{2}{x^2}}}{\frac{3x}{|x|} - \frac{6}{|x|}} \end{align*} $$ What’s next? How do we simplify the absolute value? well this depends on where we’re going. We know that \(|x|\) is just a piecewise function such that \(|x|=\) $$ \begin{align*} x \quad \text{ if \(x \geq 0\)} \\ -x \quad \text{ if \(x &lt; 0\)} \\ \end{align*} $$ And we’re approaching positive infinity. This means we’re going to substitute \(x\) with really large positive values! so we can do this, $$ \begin{align*} \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\frac{\sqrt{x^2+2}}{\sqrt{x^2}}}{\frac{3x}{|x|} - \frac{6}{|x|}} &amp; = \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\sqrt{1+\frac{2}{x^2}}}{\frac{3x}{x} - \frac{6}{x}} = \frac{\sqrt{1+0}}{3 - 0} = \frac{1}{3} \end{align*} $$ References: Professor Leonard: Limits of Functions at Infinity]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Graphing The Exponential Function</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/04/15/graph-function-exponential.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Graphing The Exponential Function" /><published>2024-04-15T01:01:36-07:00</published><updated>2024-04-15T01:01:36-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/04/15/graph-function-exponential</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/04/15/graph-function-exponential.html"><![CDATA[<p>These notes are taken from watching the video in the reference. Suppose we want to graph the function of the form,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) = a^x
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>First, if \(a &lt; 0\), then we’ll run into complex numbers and other issues so typically the exponential function is defined for any base that is greater than zero. So Suppose \(a &gt; 0\). We will still see that we have three cases:</p>
<ul>
	<li> When $$a &lt; 1$$, we'll see something like this: (this is the function $$0.5^x$$). As $$x$$ gets larger, $$y$$ will approach $$0$$. We can see this because $$f(1) = 1/2$$, $$f(2) = 1/4, f(3) = 1/8$$ and so on. 
	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/0.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p></li>
	<li> When $$a = 1$$, we'll see just the line $$y = 1$$. $$1^x$$ is 1 no matter what $$x$$ is! so not really interesting.</li>
	<li> When $$a &gt; 1$$, for example when $$f(x) = 2^x$$, then as the exponent gets bigger, we'll approach infinity. $$f(1) = 2, f(2) = 4, f(3) = 0$$ and so on.
	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/1.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The trick to graphing these functions to always remember that we always have the points \((0,1)\) and \((1,a)\) plotted on our graph! so always evaluate the inputs \(0\) and \(1\).
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>The Domain and Range</b></h4>
<p>It’s important to know the domain and range to help see what the functions would look like. The domain here is any real number so \((-\infty, \infty)\). What about the range? We can never reach any number that is zero or below so the range can be written as \((0, \infty)\). This also means that \(y=0\) is a horizontal asymptote. 
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Vertical Asymptotes</b></h4>
<p>The domain is all the real numbers so we don’t have any domain issues and so we won’t have any vertical asymptotes.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Horizontal Asymptotes</b></h4>
<p>so I know intuitively that for \(a^x\) for example, the graph never reaches 0 no matter what \(x\) values we plug in. This means that \(y=0\) is a horizontal asymptote. I’ve also seen tutorials define the asymptote of exponential functions of the form \(f(x)=ca^{x+b}+d\) to be \(d\). Either way? it’s kind of clear? or maybe now?
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>$$e^x$$</b></h4>
<p>\(e^x\) comes up frequently but is there anything special about graphing it? not really. It is very similar to the above.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/2.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Vertical Shift</b></h4>
<p>What happens if we’re about to graph a function like \(3^x - 2\). Notice here that we have a \(-2\). This is a vertical shift that will shift be the whole graph of the function down two units (green curve moved down 2 units from the original blue curve). Note that the horizontal asymptote is also going to shift to -2.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/3.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
<p><br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Horizontal Shift</b></h4>
<p>A horizontal shift example is the following:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) = 2^{x+2}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We know originally we had \(2^x\) along with a horizontal asymptote at \(y=0\) and the points \((0,1)\) and \((1,2)\). What’s going to happen now? The whole graph is going to shift 2 points to the left (opposite of the sign in the exponent). This means that the x coordinates of the all the points we plotted for the original graph will now decrease by two. So \((0,1)\) will be \(()-2,1)\). Similarly, \((1,2)\) will now be \((-1,2)\). One more thing that we usually plot is the y-intercept. To find it, we just evaluate \(f(0) = 2^{0+2} = 4\). The horizontal asymptote is unaffected here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/4.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Reflection Around the Horizontal Asymptote</b></h4>
<p>Suppose we’re graphing the following function:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) = -3^x + 1.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We can see here that we have a negative sign in front of the exponential. \((- (3^x))\). This negative sign will reflect the whole curve around its horizontal asymptote which is \(y=1\) in this example. To graph this function, let’s start by graphing the original function \(3^x\) with the known two points \((0,1)\) and \((1,3)\) as well as the horizontal asymptote at \(y=0\).
<br />
<br />
Next,</p>
<ul>
	<li> We have a vertical shift (+1) and so the horizontal asymptote will move up by one point be $$y=1$$. So the new points will be $$(0,2)$$ and $$(1,4)$$. The black curve ($$3^x$$) shifts up to become the purple curve ($$3^x+1$$). 
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/5a.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
</li>	
		
<li> The negative sign infront reflects the curve around the horizontal asymptote $$y=1$$. For this step it might also be easier to also evaluate the known points keeping in mind that we expect to see a reflection so $$f(0) = -(3^0)+1=0$$ and $$f(1) = -(3^1)+1=-2$$.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/5b.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>More Examples</b></h4>
<p>Suppose we’re graphing the following function:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) = 5 - 2e^{-x+1}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We have a lot going on here. Let’s re-arrange so that:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) = - 2e^{-(x-1)} + 5.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Before diving in, let’s graph the \(e^x\) so we can have something to compare against.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/6-a.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
<p>So this is \(e^x\) along with the points \((0,1)\) and \((1,e)\). Now, let’s dive into the transformations:</p>
<ul>

<li>If we look at the exponent and inside the parenthesis, we see that we have a -1. This means that it's a shift to the right by 1. This also means that our points' x-coordinates will shift by 1 and so $$(0,1)$$ and $$(1,e)$$ will now be $$(1,1)$$ and $$(2,e)$$. </li>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/6-b.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
The green curve above is the graph of $$e^{(x-1)}$$.

<li>But what about the negative sign outside the parenthesis in the exponent? This negative sign will reflect the graph around the y-axis. But it's tricker here because we moved the points 1 point to the right! so what we want to reflect this graph around $$x=1$$ instead.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/6-c.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
The red curve above is the graph of $$e^{-(x-1)}$$.

<li>Next we have the "2" factor at the beginning will just stretch the graph vertically by 2. There is also a negative sign. This negative sign will cause the curve to get reflected around the horizontal asymptote this time. </li>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/6-d.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
The black curve above is the graph of $$-2e^{-(x-1)}$$. Now we'll have the points $$(1,-2)$$ and $$(0,-2e)$$.

<li>Finally, the vertical shift is 5 so the horizontal asymptote moves to $$y=5$$ and the y-coordinate of all the points will be increased by 5.</li>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/6-e.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
The green curve above is the graph of $$-2e^{-(x-1)} + 5$$. Now we'll have the points $$(1,3)$$ and $$(0,-2e+5)$$.</li>
</ul>

<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>To do this, we’ll need to relate a few quantities that are bigger and smaller than \(\sin(x)/x\). Let’s start:
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>The Area of the Triangle $$ABC$$</b></h4>
<p>Suppose we have the following triangle \(ABC\) inside the unit circle.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/calculus/limit-sin-x/0.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<p>We know the area of a triangle is,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a = \frac{1}{2}bh
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>where \(b\) is the length of the base and \(h\) is the height of the triangle. Since this is a unit circle then \(b = AB = 1\) because the radius of the unit circle is 1 by construction. 
<br /><br />
What about the height? The height is \(CE\). What is \(CE\)? If we look at the smaller triangle, we’ll see \(\sin(x) = \frac{opp}{hyp} = \frac{CE}{1} = CE\). So the height is just \(\sin(x)\). 
<br /><br />
So the area of the pink triangle \(ABC\) is therefore,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a &amp;= \frac{1}{2}bh \\
a &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(1)(\sin(x)) \\
&amp;= \frac{sin(x)}{2}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h4><b>The Area of the Sector $$ABC$$</b></h4>
<p>Now we want to calculate the area of the following shaded sector,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/calculus/limit-sin-x/1.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<p>The area of the sector is</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
sector &amp;= \frac{1}{2}r\theta
&amp;= \frac{1}{2}x
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h4><b>The Area of the Triangle $$ABD$$</b></h4>
<p>The last area we’re interested in is the area of the biggest (extended) triangle,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/calculus/limit-sin-x/2.png" width="65%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Again, we know the area of a triangle is</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a = \frac{1}{2}bh
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We established earlier that the base \(AB\) is 1. What about the height? The angle \(\angle ABD\) is a right angle by construction so \(DB\) is equal to the height of the triangle. What is \(DB\)? We can’t use \(\sin(x)\) like last time because we don’t know anything about the length of \(AD\). However we do know the length of \(AB\) and one way to relate \(AB\) and \(DB\) together is through \(\tan(x)\). So,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\tan(x) &amp;= \frac{opp}{adj} \\
&amp;= \frac{DB}{1} \quad (\text{because $$adj = r = 1$$})\\
&amp;= DB \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>The length of the bigger triangle \(ABD\) is therefore,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a &amp;= \frac{1}{2}bh \\
a &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(1)(\tan(x)) \\
&amp;= \frac{tan(x)}{2}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h4><b>Finding the Limit</b></h4>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/calculus/limit-sin-x/2.png" width="65%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Looking back at the areas of the triangles and sector, we know that the area of the biggest triangle must be greater than the area of the sector and the area of the sector is greater than the area of the smaller triangle (proof?). Using this we can write the following inequality,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{sin(x)}{2} &lt; \frac{1}{2}x &lt; \frac{tan(x)}{2}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We can further simplify and also divide by \(\sin(x)\). Note here that \(sin(x)\) is postive,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
sin(x) &amp;&lt; x &lt; tan(x) \\
\frac{sin(x)}{sin(x)} &amp;&lt; \frac{x}{sin(x)} &lt; \frac{tan(x)}{sin(x)} \\
\frac{sin(x)}{sin(x)} &amp;&lt; \frac{x}{sin(x)} &lt; \frac{tan(x)}{sin(x)} \\
1 &amp;&lt; \frac{x}{sin(x)} &lt; \frac{tan(x)}{sin(x)} \\
1 &amp;&lt; \frac{x}{sin(x)} &lt; \frac{1}{cos(x)} \\
1 &amp;\geq \frac{sin(x)}{x} \geq cos(x) \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>If we. try to find the limit as \(x\) goes to 0 of the first and last term we will find that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to 0} 1 = 1.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Similarly we can also find the limit of the last term here</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to 0} \cos(x) = 1.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We can now use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_theorem">Squeeze Theorem</a> to conclude that</p>
<div>
$$

Let’s start: The Area of the Triangle $$ABC$$ Suppose we have the following triangle \(ABC\) inside the unit circle. We know the area of a triangle is, $$ \begin{align*} a = \frac{1}{2}bh \end{align*} $$ where \(b\) is the length of the base and \(h\) is the height of the triangle. Since this is a unit circle then \(b = AB = 1\) because the radius of the unit circle is 1 by construction. What about the height? The height is \(CE\). What is \(CE\)? If we look at the smaller triangle, we’ll see \(\sin(x) = \frac{opp}{hyp} = \frac{CE}{1} = CE\). So the height is just \(\sin(x)\).

<p>So how do you go about graphing a trigonometric function of the form,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a\sin(b(x + s)) + d
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Let’s study each coefficient and figure out what it does to the original graph and how it transforms it.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>What Values Do We Plot?</b></h4>
<p>Before deciding on the values, we need to understand that both sine and cosine repeat their values at regular intervals or periods. The period of \(\sin(x)\) and \(\cos(x)\) is exactly \(2\pi\). So the sine or cosine wave will just repeat every \(2\pi\). This means we can just focus on plotting one single entire wave and then just repeat the rest.
<br />
<br />
What \(x\) values do we pick in the period \([0,2\pi]\)? For both sine and cosine, we typically choose the 5 critical value where we’re crossing the \(x\) axis (\(x\) intercept) or where we have a maximum or a minimum. For both sine and cosine, This happens at \(0, \pi/2, \pi, 2\pi/3\) and \(2\pi\). Sine has 3 zeros at \(0\), \(\pi\) and \(2\pi\). Cosine has two zeros at \(\pi/2\) and \(3\pi/2\). If we’re graphing \(\sin(x)\), then we’ll have the following table,</p>
<table>
<tr>
	<td>x</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi\)</td>	
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{2}\)</td>
	<td>\(2\pi\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>y</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>0</td>	
	<td>-1</td>
	<td>0</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This table will just repeat in the next period from \(2\pi\) to \(4\pi\) and so on.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Amplitude</b></h4>
<p>\(a\) is the amplitude. This indicates how far up and down the wave of sine or cosine would go. Say we’re given the function,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2}\sin(x)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>With the new amplitude, we’ll take the original \(y\) values and just multiply them by the amplitude. To do that, we can add two new rows to the table. Notice here that \(x\) doesn’t change since the amplitude doesn’t shift the graph in any way and the \(y\) values are just multiplied by the amplitude.</p>
<table>
<tr>
	<td>x</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi\)</td>	
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{2}\)</td>
	<td>\(2\pi\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>y</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>0</td>	
	<td>-1</td>
	<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>New x</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi\)</td>	
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{2}\)</td>
	<td>\(2\pi\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>New y</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>.5</td>
	<td>0</td>	
	<td>-.5</td>
	<td>0</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/graphs/1.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>
<p>and we’re done.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Period</b></h4>
<p>We know both \(\sin(x)\) and \(\cos(x)\) have a period of \(2\pi\). Suppose we want to graph the following function,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2}\sin(2x)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>To find the period we divide \(2\pi\) by \(2\) so the new period is now \(\pi\) instead of \(2\pi\). Why do we divide? This value 2 that is multiplied by \(x\) is squeezing our sine wave. If it was 0.5, then this will be a stretching factor and our period will stretch to become \(4\pi\). 
<br />
<br />
The easiest way to graph this new function is to take the new period \(\pi\) and divide it into 5 sections. We can do so by dividing the period by 4 to figure out the distance between each section. Divide \(\pi\) by 4 to get \(\pi/4\). So now the first critical value will happen at 0. The next one will happen at \(0+\pi/4\). The one after will happen at \(0+\pi/4+\pi/4 = \pi/2\) and so on until we reach the fifth critical value at exactly \(\pi\).</p>
<table>
<tr>
	<td>New \(x\)</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)</td>	
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi\)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Let’s copy over the original values from the graph of \(\sin(x)\).</p>
<table>
<tr>
	<td>\(x\)</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi\)</td>	
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{2}\)</td>
	<td>\(2\pi\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>\(y\)</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>0</td>	
	<td>-1</td>
	<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>New x</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)</td>	
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi\)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>And then compute the new \(y\) values by multiplying by the amplitude</p>
<table>
<tr>
	<td>\(x\)</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi\)</td>	
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{2}\)</td>
	<td>\(2\pi\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>\(y\)</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>0</td>	
	<td>-1</td>
	<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>New \(x\)</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)</td>	
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>New \(y\)</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>.5</td>
	<td>0</td>	
	<td>-.5</td>
	<td>0</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>That’s it! We didn’t have to plug in any \(x\) values in the function and compute it. We just copied the \(y\) values we had. This works because we took the new period and determined first where the x-intercept will happen (we know with \(\sin(x)\) that it happens at 3 places (beginning, middle, end)). And then we determined where the peak and minimum will happen. This happens at the first and third quarter of the period. The reason why we do it this way is because often we’ll get the critical \(x\) values at positions where we don’t know off hand what the sine value would be (none of the famous angles we know). And if we don’t have a calculator then we’d be stuck so this is an easy way to avoid needing a calculator.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/graphs/2.png" width="100%" class="center" /></p>

<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Horizontal Shift</b></h4>
<p>Let’s now focus on the horizontal shift that could happen by having a term inside (not to be confused with the period). Here 2 is the period and \(-\pi/2\) is the shift.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2}\sin(2(x - \frac{\pi}{2}))
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>What does this \(-\pi/2\) do? 
<br />
<br />
First of all, we know the period is \(2\pi/2 = \pi\) from the last section and we know the \(x\) values of the new period will be,</p>
<table>
<tr>
	<td>New \(x\)</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)</td>	
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi\)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>But now we also have a shifting factor of \(-\pi/2\). This factor shifts the graph to the right by \(\pi/2\) (Why to the right)? Now we’re going to start our period at \(\pi/2\) instead of 0 like we’re used to. So the whole row of \(x\) values we generated above weill need to get shifted by adding \(\pi/2\).</p>
<table>
<tr>
	<td>New \(x\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi/2\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{4}+\frac{pi}{2} = \frac{3\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{2}+\frac{pi}{2} = \pi\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{4}+\frac{pi}{2} = \frac{7\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi + \frac{pi}{2} = \frac{3\pi}{2}\)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Let’s copy over the original values from the graph of \(\sin(x)\).</p>
<table>
<tr>
	<td>\(x\)</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi\)</td>	
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{2}\)</td>
	<td>\(2\pi\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>\(y\)</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>0</td>	
	<td>-1</td>
	<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>New \(x\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi/2\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{7\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{2}\)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Finally, let’s calculate the new \(y\) using the original values and multiplying then by the amplitude.</p>
<table>
<tr>
	<td>\(x\)</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi\)</td>	
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{2}\)</td>
	<td>\(2\pi\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>\(y\)</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>0</td>	
	<td>-1</td>
	<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>New \(x\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi/2\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{7\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{2}\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>New \(y\)</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>.5</td>
	<td>0</td>	
	<td>-.5</td>
	<td>0</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/graphs/3.png" width="100%" class="center" /></p>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Vertical Shift</b></h4>
<p>The last thing we want to know is how to apply the vertical shift. What we want to do is take our x-axis and pretend to lift it either up or down depending on the vertical shift we have. So if we’re graphing something like</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2}\sin(2(x - \frac{\pi}{2})) + 1
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Then this means that we are shifting up the graph by 1 point. So we’ll take that row of \(y\) values and add 1 everywhere. The \(x\) values will remain the same from the last section.</p>
<table>
<tr>
	<td>\(x\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi/2\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{7\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{2}\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>\(y\)</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>.5</td>
	<td>0</td>	
	<td>-.5</td>
	<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>New \(x\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi/2\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\pi\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{7\pi}{4}\)</td>
	<td>\(\frac{3\pi}{2}\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>New \(y\)</td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>1.5</td>
	<td>1</td>	
	<td>0.5</td>
	<td>1</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>So you can see here the red graph from the last section and now it’s shifted up by 1 point!</p>

<p>Given some function \(f\). A slanted asymptote occurs when the degree of the numerator (\(m\)) is larger than the degree of the denominator (\(n\)) by exactly 1 so \(m = n + 1\). 
<br />
<br />
To re-iterate from the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/04/10/graph-horizontal-asymptotes.html">horizontal asymptotes post</a>, we have three cases:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The case when $$m = n$$. Here, we'll have a horizontal asymptote at $$a_m/a_n$$ where $$a_m$$ and $$a_n$$ are the leading coefficients of each of the highest terms</li>
	<li>The case when $$m &lt; n$$. Here, we'll have a horizontal asymptote at $$y = 0$$. </li>
	<li>The case when $$m &gt; n$$. Here we won't have a horizontal asymptote and for $$m = n + 1$$ we will have a slanted asymptote which is what this post is about!</li>

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Finding the Slanted Asymptote</b></h4>
<p>For example, suppose we have the function,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) &amp;= \frac{3x^4-x^2}{x^3-x^2+1}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We said before that when we study the end behavior of rational functions, we will focus on the largest power in both the numerator and the denominator. This is because as the input gets larger and larger (end behavior!), only the largest powers will matter and will completely take over in determining how the functions will behave). So let’s focus on the these only,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) &amp;\approx \frac{3x^4}{x^3} \\
&amp;\approx 3x \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>When \(x\) approaches positive infinity, this function will also approach positive infinity. Similarly, as \(x\) approaches negative infinity, the function approach negative infinity. This line \(y=3x\) has a slope of 3 which the slanted asymptote will follow.
<br />
<br /> 
However find the slope isn’t enough because we need to find the equation of the whole line/asymptote. So we still need to find the \(y\) intercept which will require us to perform long division to find it. 
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Finding the $$y$$ Intercept of the Slanted Asymptote</b></h4>
<p>We’ll divide the numerator by the denominator (see video for how it’s done). The divison will result in \(3x + 3\) and some remainder. We won’t care about the remainder since as we approach infinity, the remainder will approach zero. So the equation of the slanted asymptote will just be \(3x + 3\) and this is exactly the slanted asymptote we’re looking for.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Can you cross a slanted asymptote</b></h4>
<p>yes. we can definitely cross a slanted asymptote especially when it’s still early. The horizontal and slanted asymptotes show their effects more as \(x\) gets really large (whether toward positive or negative infinity).
