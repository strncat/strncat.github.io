Take operation or product on a set $$G$$ is a function from $$G \times G$$ to $$G$$. This set $$G$$ with the operation is a group. More formally,
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition 1.10.1
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
A group is a (nonempty) set \(G\) with a product satisfying the following properties:
<ol type="a">
	<li>The group is closed under the operation. </li>
	<li>The product is associative. For all \(a, b, c \in G\), we have (ab)c = a(bc).</li>
	<li>There is an identity element \(e \in G\) with property that for all \(a \in G\), \(ea = ae = a\).</li>
	<li>For each element \(a \in G\), there is an element \(a^{-1}\ \in G\) satisfying \(aa^{-1} = a^{-1}a = e\) (The inverse).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
So If we have a set of objects with an operation such that the rules above are satisfied and most importantly when you apply th then this set along with the operation is a group. What are some examples of groups?
<ol type="a">
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}\) with the addition operation.</li>
	<li>The set of invertible \(n \times n\) matrices with entries in \(\mathbf{R}\) with matrix multiplication as the product.</li>
	<li>For each element \(a \in G\), there is an element \(a^{-1}\ \in G\) satisfying \(aa^{-1} = a^{-1}a = e\).</li>
	<li>See more visual examples in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7L_r6zw4-c">video</a></li>
</ol>
