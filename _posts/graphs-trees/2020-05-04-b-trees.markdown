B-trees are balanced search trees. While red-black trees are also balanced search trees, their branching factor is only 2. B-trees differ in that their branching factor can be really large. The number of keys in a B-tree node determines the number of its children. A node with $$n$$ keys have $$n+1$$ children. This way, each child handles a specific range of keys in its parent.

<h4><b>Motivation</b></h4>
But why do we need a large branching factor? The motivation behind this idea has to do with minimizing disk I/O operations. Data on disk can be read in <i>pages</i> and so if each node's size is a whole page in which we pack a lot of keys in, we can then minimize the number of read operations.

<h4><b>Specifications</b></h4>
- Let $$x$$ be an internal node and let $$n$$ be the number of keys stored at $$x$$. $$x$$ must have $$n+1$$ children. Furthermore, the keys are stored in non-decreasing order. Leaf nodes on the other hand have no children. No restrictions on the number of children of the root. 

- The minimum degree of a b-tree is an integer, $$t$$ such that $$t \geq 2$$. Every node besides the root must have between $$t-1$$ and $$2t-1$$ keys. This also implies that it must have at least $$t$$ children and at most $$2t$$ children. If the tree is not empty, the root must be at least have 1 key.

- The keys in each node are stored in non-decreasing order. The keys also define the range of keys stored in the children subtrees below. In the above figure, We see the range [0,23] defines the range for the child keys below [11,19]. Similarly [23,53] defines the range for the next child's keys [29,43].

<h4><b>Why are B-trees balanced?</b></h4>
To see why B-trees are balanced, we will prove that the maximum height of a b-tree of degree $$t$$ with $$n$$ keys is $$O(\log_t(n))$$. 
<br>
<br>
Proof: At level 0, the root must at least have 1 key. At level 1 we must have two children, each of which must have at least $$t-1$$ keys, so the total number of keys is $$2(t-1)$$. Each of these children will have at least $$t$$ children and so at level 2, we should have $$2t(t-1)$$ keys. Therefore, the total number of keys is at least

\begin{align*}
n &\geq 1 + 2(t-1) + 2t(t-1) + 2t^2(t-1) + ... + 2t^{h-1}(t-1) \\
&= 1 + 2(t-1)(1 + t + t^2 + ... t^{h-1}) \\
&= 1 + 2(t-1)\frac{t^h - 1}{t - 1} \text{ (using } \sum_{k=0}^{n}x^k = \frac{x^{n+1} - 1}{x - 1} ) \\
&= 1 + 2(t^h - 1) \\
&= 2t^h - 1 \\
\log_t(\frac{n + 1}{2}) &\geq \log_t(h) \\
h &\leq \log_t(\frac{n + 1}{2}). \blacksquare
\end{align*}

<h4><b>Search</b></h4>
Similar to searching in a binary tree, we descend down the tree and select the right branch based on the key value. In $B$-trees, each node has has $n$ keys and so this means that we have $n+1$ children or branches. We need to compare our key with these $n$ keys to find the right child/branch to descend into.

<br>
Each node stores an array of its keys. In the figure above, suppose we're currently at node $x$ during the search and suppose we're searching for $k = 84$. We first want to find the smallest index such that $k \leq keys[i]$. For $k=84$, the smallest index is $i = 3$. 101 is the smallest key that is larger than 84. We then have several cases:
- $k = keys[i]$. This is great, we just return $x$ with the index of the key $i$.
- $x$ is a leaf node so we return NULL.
- $k \neq keys[i]$. $k$ falls somewhere between the key at index $$i-1$$ and the key at index $$i$$. This range corresponds to the child at index $$i$$. We call search again on the $i$th child.

{% highlight c++ %}
// search a b-tree of degree t 
search(x, k) {
    int i = 0;
    // search for the smallest index such that k <= keys[i]
    // this means k will be in the range (keys[i-1], keys[i])
    while (i < x.n && k > x.keys[i]) {
        i++;
    }
    // three possible cases
    if (index < x.n && x.keys[i] == k) { // key found
        return (x, i);
    } else if (x.leaf) { // x is a leaf node
         return NULL; // no more possible matches
    } else {
        return search(x.child[i], k);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>How long does Search take?</b></h4>
Note that in the above method, we were using a linear search to find the right key. For a tree of degree $t$, each node can have at most $2t-1$ keys. So this search takes $O(t)$ time. Since the tree height is $O(log_t(n))$ then the total cost is $O(t\log_t(n))$.
<br>
<br>
Suppose we instead use <i>binary search</i> to find the key. This means that each search will now take $O(\log(t))$ time and so the total cost becomes $O(\log(t)\log_t(n))$. Re-writing $\log_t(n)$ as $\frac{\log(n)}{\log(t)}$, we see that the total time is $O(\log(n))$.
