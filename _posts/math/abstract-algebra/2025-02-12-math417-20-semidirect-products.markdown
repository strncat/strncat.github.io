Previously we introduced the direct product group and we observed if some certain conditions are met, then we get a direct product that is isomorphic to the group $$G$$ itself. As a reminder
<br>

Theorem (Recognition Theorem)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and \(A, N \leq G\). If
<ol>
	<li>\(A\) and \(N\) are normal subgroups of \(G\).</li>
	<li>\(A \cap N = \{e\}\)</li>
	<li>\(AN = G\)</li>
</ol>
Then, \(A \times N\) is isomorphic to \(G\). The isomorphism is given by
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: A \times N &\rightarrow G \\
	 (a,n) &\rightarrow an
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
But now the question is what happens if not all of these conditions are satisfied. Suppose that $$N$$ was the only normal subgroup. In this case, $$G$$ is called a semi-direct product of $$N$$ and $$A$$.
<br>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
Let $$G = D_n$$ where $$n \geq 3$$ and $$|G| = 2n$$. Let
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	N &= \langle r \rangle, \ o(r) = n \\
	A &= \langle j \rangle, \ o(j) = 2
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
We know that $$N \cap A = \{e\}$$ and $$A \cap N = G$$. We also know that $$\langle r \rangle$$ is a normal subgroup while $$\langle j \rangle$$ is not. Remember that $$\langle r \rangle$$ is normal since if we conjugate any rotation $$r^k$$ by any flip, then the result is still a rotation $$jr^kj^{-1} = r^{-k} \in N$$.
<br>
<br>
So the only thing missing to be able to apply the recognition theorem is that $$A$$ is not normal. Despite this, we will show that we can still construct $$G = D_n$$ from the subgroups $$N$$, $$A$$ and a homomorphism $$\gamma$$.  In other words, $$G$$ is isomorphic to $$N \rtimes_{\gamma} A$$, $$G \cong N \rtimes_{\gamma} A$$.
<br>
<br>
What is this homomorphism $$\gamma$$? $$\gamma$$ will be a homomorphism from $$A$$ to the group of automorphisms of $$N$$. So for example, In $$A = \langle j \rangle$$ (generated by $$j$$), we will send each element in an automorphism from the set $$\text{Aut}(N) = \text{Aut}(\langle r \rangle)$$. Specifically
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\gamma: A &\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\
	e &\rightarrow id \\
	j &\rightarrow \gamma_j, \quad \gamma_j(r^k) = r^{-k}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
$$\gamma$$ is a homomorphism of groups.
