Suppose we’re given a bill of value $n=5$. We’re also given unlimited amount of coins. The possible coin values are 1, 2 and 5. What is the total number of ways of changing the bill into coins? We can exchange it for 5 coins of value 1. We can also exchange it for 3 coins of value 1 and 1 coin of value 2. Here are total possible ways:

How can we design an algorithm to solve this problem?

<h4><b>Method 1</b></h4>
<p>One way to count the number of ways to make change is to iterate through the coins and use each coin as a  starting point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start with a coin of value 5, then make change for $n-5$.</li>
  <li>Start with a coin of value 2, then make change for $n-2$.</li>
  <li>Start with a coin of value 1, then make change for $n-1$.</li>
</ul>
