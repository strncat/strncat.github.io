I"ê<p><b>Proposition</b>: If two integers have opposite parity, then their sum is odd.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<b>Proof.</b><br />
Suppose $m$ and $n$ are two integers with opposite parity. We will show that their sum is odd. 
Without the loss of generality, suppose $m$ is even and $n$ is odd. Therefore, $m = 2k$ for some $k \in Z$ and $n = 2l+1$ for some $l in Z$. Therefore, $m + n = 2k + 2l + 1 = 2(k + l) + 1$ which is odd by definition.</p>

\begin{align*}
1 + (-1)^n(2n-1) &amp;= 1 + (-1)^{(2k+1)}(2(2k+1)-1) \\
&amp;= 1 + (-1)^{(2k+1)}(4k+2-1) \\
&amp;= 1 + -1(4k+1) \\
&amp;= 1 + -4k -1 \\
&amp;= -4k.
\end{align*}
