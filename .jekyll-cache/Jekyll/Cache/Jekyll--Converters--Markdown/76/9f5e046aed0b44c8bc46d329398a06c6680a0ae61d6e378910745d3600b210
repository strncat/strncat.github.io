Proposition 1.6.18
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(p\) is a prime number and \(a\) is any nonzero integer, then either \(p\) divides \(a\) or \(p\) and \(a\) are relatively prime.
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Suppose that \(p\) is a prime number and \(a\) is a nonzero integer. Suppose that \(a &gt; 0\), if not then just consider \(-a\). \(a\) can be written as a product of prime numbers \(p_1,...,p_k\). We have two cases. Either \(p\) is one of the prime factors of \(a\) so \(p\) divides \(a\). Or \(p\) is not any of the prime factors of \(a\). So \(p\) doesnâ€™t divide \(a\). But since \(p\) is a prime number, then it wonâ€™t have any other prime factors and therefore, \(p\) and \(a\) are relatively prime. \(\ \blacksquare\).

Theorem 1.6.21
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
The prime factorization of a natural number is unique.
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
Suppose \(n\) is a natural number. We want to show that if \(n\) has the following factorizations</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
n = q_1q_2 ... q_r, \\
n = p_1p_2 ... p_s
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>where \(q_1,...,q_r\) and \(p_1,...,p_s\) are prime numbers, \(q_1 \leq ... \leq q_s\) and \(p_1 \leq ... \leq p_s\), that these factorizations are the same. In other words, \(r = s\) and \(q_i = p_i\) for all \(i\). We will show this by induction on \(n\):
<br />
<br />
Base Case (\(n = 1\)): 1 canâ€™t be written as a product of a non-empty collection of prime numbers. For \(n=2\), 2 has only one prime factor (itself) since itâ€™s a prime number.
<br />
<br />
Inductive Case: Suppose the inductive hypothesis is true for any natural number less than \(n\). Now consider \(n\) and its factorizations above. Assume without the loss of generality that \(q_1 \leq p_1\). We know that \(q_1\) divides \(n\). By Proposition 1.6.20, \(q_1\) must divide the product \(p_1p_2...p_s\). So this means that \(q_1\) must be equal to one of the factors \(p_1,...,p_s\). But since \(q_1 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 ... \leq p_k\), then we must have \(p_1 = q_1\). So now divide both equations by \(q_1\) to see that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
n/q_1 = q_2 ... q_r, \\
n/q_1 = p_2 ... p_s
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We can now apply the inductive hypothesis to conclude that \(r = s\) and \(q_i = p_i\) for all \(i \geq 2\). \(\ \blacksquare\).
