Some facts about the integers
<ul>
	<li>\((\mathbf{Z}, +)\) is a commutative group. \(+\) is associative and commutative. The identity element is \(0\) and each element \(a\)'s inverse is \(-a\).</li>
	<li>\((\mathbf{Z}, \cdot)\) is a commutative monoid. \(\cdot\) is associative and commutative. The identity element is \(1\). (No inverses required)</li>
	<li>Distributive Law: \(a(b+c) = (ab) + (ac), \forall a,b,c \in \mathbf{Z}\). (side note: the list of properties so far for reference imply that \(\mathbf{Z}\) is a commutative ring with unit.</li>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z} / \{0\}\) is closed under multiplication. In other words, if \(a \neq, b \neq 0\), then \(ab \neq 0\) We can also re-write this by taking its contrapositive so \(ab = 0\) implies that \(a = 0\) or \(b = 0\).</li>
	<li>\(\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{Z}_{>0}\) is closed under \(+\) and \(\cdot\).</li>
	<li>If \(a, b \in \mathbf{Z} / \{0\}\), then \( |ab| \geq \max\{|a|,|b|\} \). (Note that \(a > b\) means that \(a - b \in \mathbf{Z}_{>0}\).)</li>

<h3>Divisibility</h3>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(a, b \in \mathbf{Z}\). \(a\) <b>divides</b> \(b\) (write \(a | b\)) if there exists \(m \in \mathbf{Z}\) such that \(am = b\).
<br>
(We also say that \(a\) is a factor of \(b\) or \(b\) is a multiple of \(a\)).
<br>
In fact, \(a|b\) if and only if \(\frac{b}{a} \in \mathbf{Z} \text{if $a \neq 0$}\).
</div>
<br>
The factors or divisors of $$6$$ for example are $$\{\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6\}$$ while the divisors of $$0$$ are all of $$\mathbf{Z}$$. We also have the set of all multiplies of integer $$a$$ so if $$a$$ is 7, then the set is $$\{...,-14,-7,0,7,14,21,...\}$$. Notation: we will denote the set of all multiples as
<div> 
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{Z}a = \{na \ | \ n \in \mathbf{Z}\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Divisibility Properties</h3>
The following are some well known propositions about divisibility.
<ol>
	<li>If \(a | b\) and \(b | a\), then \(b \in \{\pm a\}\)</li>
	<li>If \(a | 1\), then \(a \in \{\pm 1\}\)</li>
	<li>If \(a | b\) and \(b | c\), then \(a | c\)</li>
	<li>If \(a | b\) and \(a | c\), then \(a | (b + c)\)</li>
	<li>If \(a | b\) and \(a | c\), then \(a | (mb + nc) \quad \forall m, n \in \mathbf{Z}\)</li>
</ol>
Note that 
<div> 
$$
\begin{align*}
a | b \Leftrightarrow b \in \mathbf{Z}a \Leftrightarrow \mathbf{Z}b \subseteq \mathbf{Z}c
\end{align*}

<h3>Prime Numbers</h3>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition 1.6.3
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
A natural number is prime if (i) \(n < 1\) and (ii) the only positive divisors of \(n\) are \(\{1, n\}\).
</div>
<br>
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 1.6.4
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Every \(n \in \mathbf{N}\) greater than 1 is equal to a product of primes (at least one).
</div>
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b><br>
By Induction on $$n \geq 2$$. 
<br>
Base Case: $$n = 2:$$ 2 is a prime so it's a product of one prime.
<br>
<br>
Inductive Case $$n > 2$$: 
<br>
Suppose that inductive hypothesis is true for any number $$r$$ where $$2 \leq r < n$$. Now, take $$n$$. We have two cases. If $$n$$ is a prime number, then $$n$$ is a product of primes and we're done. Otherwise, $$n$$ is not a prime and has divisors other than $$1$$ or itself. Let these divisors be $$a$$ and $$b$$ so that $$n = ab$$. $$a$$ and $$b$$ are not $$n$$ or $$1$$ so we know that $$1 < a < n$$ and $$1 < b < n$$. We can now apply the inductive hypothesis to conclude that both $$a$$ and $$b$$ can be written as a product of primes. Therefore, $$n = ab$$ is also a product of primes. $$\ \blacksquare$$

<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem 1.6.6 (Euclid)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
There are infinitely many prime numbers.
</div>
<br>
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there are finitely many primes $$p_1,p_2,...,p_k$$. Consider $$p = p_1p_2...p_k + 1 \in \mathbf{N}$$. We know that $$p$$ is greater than any of the primes $$p_1,p_2,...,p_k$$. Observe now that none of these primes $$p_1, p_2,...,p_k$$ can divide $$p$$. Why? because if any of these primes did (say it was $$p_i$$), then this means that $$p_i \ | \ n$$. But $$p_i$$ also divides the product $$p_1p_2...p_k$$. By the last fact of integers above, then $$p_i \ | \ (n - p_1p_2...p_k)$$. So $$p_i \ | \ 1$$. But that's impossible so $$p_i$$ can't divide $$n$$. But by Proposition 1.6.4, $$p$$ must be a product of primes. Therefore, there must be another prime or $$p$$ itself is a prime. This is a contradiction and so we can conclude that there are infinitely many primes. $$\ \blacksquare$$

<h3>Divison with Remainder</h3>
The way we learn division is this. Given $$a, d \in \mathbf{Z}, d > 0$$, then $$\frac{a}{d} = q + \frac{r}{d}$$. The quotient, $$q \in \mathbf{Z}$$ and the remainder $$r \in \mathbf{Z}$$. Moreover, $$\frac{r}{d} \in [0,1)$$. Stated differently,
<br>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 1.6.7
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Given integers \(a\) and \(d \in \mathbf{Z}\) with \(d \geq 1\), there exists unique integers \(q\) and \(r\) such that 
$$
\begin{align*}
a = qd + r
\end{align*}
$$
where \(0 \leq r < d\). 
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<br>
<br>
<b>Proof: (from my own notes (reading the book))</b>
<br>
<br>
We are given $$a$$ and $$d$$ such that $$d \geq 1$$. <br>
We want to find unique integers $$q$$ and $$r$$ such that $$r < d$$.
<br>
<br>
We have two cases:
<br>
$$a \geq 0$$: If $$d > a$$, then we just take $$q = 0$$ and $$r = a$$.<br>
Otherwise, suppose that $$d \leq a$$. By Induction on a. Assume that for all non-negative integers smaller than $$a$$, we can find such integers. In particular, suppose it holds for $$a - d$$, then there exists integers $$q'$$ and $$r$$ such that
<div> 
$$
\begin{align*}
(a - d) &= q'd + r \quad (\text{where } 0 \leq r < d) \\
a &= q'd + d + r \\
a &= q'(d + 1) + r 
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
And we are done.
<br>
<br>
Case $$a > 0$$: If $$a$$ is divisible by $$d$$, then there exists integer $$q$$ such that $$a = qd$$. So we can set $$r = 0$$ and we are done.
<br>
Otherwise, $$-a > 0$$ so by the first case ($$a \geq 0$$) there exists integers $$q'$$ and $$r'$$ such that $$-a = q'd + r'$$ with $$0 < r' < d$$. So
<div> 
$$
\begin{align*}
-a &= q'd + r' \\
a &= -q'd - r' \\
a &= -q'd - d + d - r' \\
a &= (-q' - 1)d + (d - r') \\
  &= (-q' - 1)d + (d - r').
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
So $$q = (-q' - 1)$$ and $$r = d - r'$$ with $$0 < d - r' < d$$ and we are done.
<br>
<br>
To show that $$q$$ and $$r$$ are unique, suppose for the sake of contradiction that they are not. Therefore suppose that $$a = qd + r = q'd + r'$$ where $$0 \leq r,r' < d$$. Subtracting the equations, we see that
<div> 
$$
\begin{align*}
(q - q')d = r - r'
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
But this means that $$r - r'$$ is divisible by d. However $$|r - r'| \leq \max\{r,r'\} < d$$, so we must have $$|r - r'| = 0$$. This implies that $$(q' - q)d = 0$$ and so $$q' = q$$ as we wanted to show. $$\ \blacksquare$$
