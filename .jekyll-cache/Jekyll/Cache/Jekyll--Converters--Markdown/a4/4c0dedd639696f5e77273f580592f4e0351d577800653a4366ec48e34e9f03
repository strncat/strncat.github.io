<p>Suppose we have an art gallery represented by a simple polygon $P$ with $n$ vertices. What is the minimum number of fixed guards needed to guard the gallery where each guard has a full visibility range of $2\pi$. How do we know if a given point is in the range of visiblity of a given guard? We say that if we were given points $x$ and $y$, then $x$ is visible from $y$ if $xy \in P$ where $P$ is a given polygon and $x, y \in P$.

<p>To start we first define a <b>line segment</b> as a closed subset of a line contained between points $a$ and $b$ called its end points. A <b>simple polygon</b> is a closed curve consisting of a finite collection of line segments that doesnâ€™t intersect itself. This means that the intersection of each pair of adjacent segments is only the vertex shared between them and such that non-adjacent segments do not intersect. In the figure above, the intersection of $e_i$ and $e_{i+1}$ is only $v_i$ and none of non-adjacent segments intersect.

<p>A <b>Diagonal</b> is a line segment between two of the polygonâ€™s vertices $a$ and $b$ such that the intersection of the line segment $ab$ with the boundary of $P$ ($\partial P$) is exactly the set ${a,b}$ or in other words, the open segment from $a$ to $b$ doesnâ€™t intersect $\partial P$. In the first figure the segment connecting $v_1$ and $v_6$ is a diagonal since the intersection of the line segment with $\partial P$ is only ${v_1,v_6}$ while in the right figure none of the red line segments are diagonals.</p>
