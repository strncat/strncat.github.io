I"¿<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">
  <b>If \(p^2\) is even, then \(p\) is even.</b>
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<h3>Proof:</h3>
<p>Suppose \(p^2\) is even and \(p\) is not. Since \(p\) is odd, let \(p = 2k+1\) where \(k\) is an integer. Now, square \(p\) so that we have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
p^2 &amp;= (2k+1)^2 \\
&amp;= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \\
&amp;= 2(2k^2+2k) + 1.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>\(2k^2 + 2k\) is an integer and so \(p^2\) has the form of an odd number so itâ€™s odd! But this is a contradiction since we established earlier that \(p^2\) is even. Therefore, \(p\) canâ€™t be odd and has to be even. \(\blacksquare\)
