<b>1 Introduction</b>
<br />
<br />
Suppose we want to ship iPhones from San Francisco to New York City because we have a current shortage of iPhones in NYC. We want to ship as many units as possible. Everything needs to be shipped by Ground. We have different routes of different capacities. We want to find the maximum number of iPhones we can ship to NYC. How can we model and solve can this problem? We’ll discuss the Ford-Fulkerson’s method but in order to describe it we have to set the stage and define a number of definitions.

<b>2 Flow Networks</b>
<img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/flow/1.png" width="100%" />
A flow network <script type="math/tex">G=(V,E)</script> is a directed graph where <br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>We have two distinguished vertices, the source vertex <script type="math/tex">s</script> and the sink vertex <script type="math/tex">t</script>.</li>
  <li>Each edge <script type="math/tex">(u,v) \in E</script> has a non-negative capacity <script type="math/tex">c(u,v) \geq 0</script>. <br /></li>
  <li>If we have edge <script type="math/tex">(u,v) \in E</script> then we must have <script type="math/tex">(u,v) \not\in E</script>. <br /></li>
  <li>For any vertex <script type="math/tex">v \in V</script>, <script type="math/tex">(v,v) \not\in E</script>. <br /></li>
  <li>If <script type="math/tex">(u,v) \not\in E</script>, then we can assume that <script type="math/tex">c(u,v)=0</script>.<br /></li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">G</script> is connected and so <script type="math/tex">|E| \geq |V| - 1</script>.
<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>
<hr />

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><br />
<b>3 What is Flow?</b>
<br /><br />
Let <script type="math/tex">f(u,v)</script> be the flow from vertex <script type="math/tex">u</script> to vertex <script type="math/tex">v</script>. A <b>flow</b> is a real valued function <script type="math/tex">f : V \times V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</script> that satisfies:<br />
(1) <b>Capacity constraint:</b> For all <script type="math/tex">u, v \in V</script>, we require</p>
<div center="">
$$
\begin{align*}
0 \leq f(u,v) \leq c(u,v)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>In other words, the flow on every edge must not exceed its capacity.
<br /><br />
(2) <b>Flow Conservation:</b> For all <script type="math/tex">u \in V - \{s,t\}</script>, we require</p>
<div center="">
$$
\begin{align*}
\sum_{v \in V}f(v,u) = \sum_{v \in V} f(u,v)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>In other words, the total flow coming into <script type="math/tex">u</script> is equal to the total flow leaving <script type="math/tex">u</script>.
<br />
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><br />
<b>4 The Maximum Flow Problem</b>
<br /></p>

<!--
Let $$|f|$$ be the flow value defined as
<div center>
$$
\begin{align*}
|f| = \sum_{v \in V}f(s,v) = \sum_{v \in V} f(v,s)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
In other words, the flow value is the total flow coming out of the source minus the total flow coming into the source. 
-->

<p>In the maximum-flow problem we are given a flow network <script type="math/tex">G</script> with a source vertex <script type="math/tex">s</script> and a sink vertex <script type="math/tex">t</script> and we are asked to find the maximum flow in <script type="math/tex">G</script> from <script type="math/tex">s</script> to <script type="math/tex">t</script>.</p>

<b>6 The Ford-Fulkerson’s Method</b>
<br /><br />
Now that we defined everything needed, we can talk about how Fold-Fulkerson solves this problem! yay! Intuitively, Ford-Fulkerson starts with <script type="math/tex">f(u,v)=0</script> for all <script type="math/tex">(u,v) \in E</script> and incrementally increases the flow value. It does so by finding an augmenting path in the residual network <script type="math/tex">G_f</script>.</p>
