  <b>Prove that \(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}\) and \(\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{5}\) are both irrational</b>
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<h3>Proof:</h3>
<p>Suppose it is a rational number and let \(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5} = \frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are integers and \(q\) is not zero. Furthermore, assume that the fraction is in its simplist form. Now we can square each side:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5} = \frac{p}{q} \\
\sqrt{3} = \frac{p}{q} - \sqrt{5} \\
(\sqrt{3})^2 &amp;= \big(\frac{p}{q} - \sqrt{5}\big)^2 \\
3 &amp;= \frac{p^2}{q^2} - 2\sqrt{5}\frac{p}{q} + 5 \\
3 &amp;= \frac{p^2}{q^2} - 2\sqrt{5}\frac{p}{q} + 5 \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>From this we can conclude that \(p^2\) is even since itâ€™s a multiple of 2. Since \(p^2\) is even, then \(p\) must be even as well. Why? Suppose it wasnâ€™t even and that \(p\) is was an odd number. Since \(p\) is odd, let \(p = 2k+1\) where \(k\) is an integer. Now, square \(p\) so that we have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
p^2 &amp;= (2k+1)^2 \\
&amp;= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \\
&amp;= 2(2k^2+2k) + 1.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>\(2k^2 + 2k\) is an integer and so \(p^2\) has the form of an odd number so itâ€™s odd! But this is a contradiction since we established earlier that \(p^2\) is even. Therefore, \(p\) canâ€™t be odd and has to be even. Since \(p\) is even, we can write \(p\) as \(2r\) where \(r\) is an integer. Letâ€™s plug in \(2r\) back in \(p^2 = 2q^2\) and simplify,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
p^2 &amp;= 2q^2 \\
(2r)^2 &amp;= 2q^2 \\
4r^2 &amp;= 2q^2 \\
2r^2 &amp;= q^2.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>But now \(q^2\) is even since itâ€™s a multiple of 2! Since \(p^2\) is even and \(q^2\) is also even then they must have at least 2 as a common factor. But we said earlier that \(p^2/q^2\) is in its simplest form. Therefore, this is a contradiction and \(\sqrt{2}\) can not be a rational number!
