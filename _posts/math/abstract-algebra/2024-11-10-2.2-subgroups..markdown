Definition 2.2.1
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
A non-empty subset \(H\) of a group \(G\) is called a subgroup if \(H\) is itself a group with the group operation inherited from \(G\). We write \(H \leq G\) to indicate that \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\).
</div>
<br>
The necessary conditions for a subset \(H\) of \(G\) to be a subgroup of \(G\) are:
<ol>
	<li>Closed under multiplication. That is, for all elements \(h_1\) and \(h_2\) of \(H\), the products \(h_1h_2\) is also an element of \(H\)</li>
	<li>Closed under inverses. For all \(h \in H\), the inverse \(h^{-1}\) is an element of \(H\)</li>
</ol>
By $$(2)$$ we know for any $$h \in H$$, $$h^{-1} \in H$$ and by (1), we know that $$hh^{-1}=e \in H$$. So the identity element is in $$H$$. Associativity is inherited from $$GG$$. From this we see that these two conditions are sufficient for $$H$$ to be a subgroup of $$G$$. Sometimes, it is easier to prove that a set is a subgroup rather than proving that it is a group since we only need to check these two conditions.

Proposition 2.2.8 (Uniqueness of the identity)
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(H_1, H_2,...,H_n\) be subgroups of \(G\). Then \(H_1 \cap H_2 \ \cap ... \cap \ H_n \) is a subgroup of \(G\). More generally, if \(\{H_{\alpha}\}\) is any collection of subgroups, then \(\cap_{\alpha}\) is a subgroup.

<h4><b>Generated Subgroups</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>For any subset \(S \subseteq G\), <b>the subgroup generated by</b> \(S\) is the smallest subgroup in \(G\) that contains \(S\) and is denoted \(\langle S \rangle\). </li>
<li>If \(S\) contains a single element, \(S = \{a\}\), then the subgroup generated by \(S\) is denoted by \(\langle a \rangle\). </li>
<li>If \(G = \langle S \rangle\), then \(G\) is generated by \(S\) or \(S\) generates \(G\)</li>
</ul>
One way to describe $$\langle S \rangle$$ is that it contains all the possible products $$g_1g_2...g_n$$ where $$g_i \in S$$ or $$g_i^{-1} \in S$$. 
<br>
Another way to describe $$\langle S \rangle$$ is that it is the intersection of the family of all subgroups of $$G$$ that contain $$S$$. This family can't be empty since $$G$$ is a group.

<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2.2.9
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(a\) be an element of a group \(G\). The subgroup \(\langle a \rangle\) generated by \(a\) is \(\{a^k \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}\).
</div>
<br>
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
Let $$H = \{a^k \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}$$. We will show that $$\langle a \rangle = H$$ as follows:
<br>
<br>
$$\langle a \rangle \subseteq H$$: We know that $$G$$ is a group and $$H$$ is subset of $$G$$. We claim that it is a subgroup of $$G$$. It is closed under multiplication because for any $$a^k$$ and $$a^l$$ in $$H$$, $$a^{k+l} \in H$$. It is closed under inverses because for any $$a^k \in H$$, $$(a^{k})^-1 = a^{-k} \in H$$. Furthermore, $$H$$ contains $$a$$ and since $$H$$ is a subgroup, then $$H$$ contains all the powers of $$a$$. Therefore, $$\langle a \rangle \subseteq H$$. 
<br>
<br>
$$H \subseteq \langle a \rangle$$: We showed that $$H = \{a^k \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}$$ is a subgroup above. It is closed under multiplication and so it contains all powers of $$a$$. Therefore, $$H \subseteq \langle a \rangle$$. $$\ \blacksquare$$

<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition 2.2.10
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(a\) be an element of a group \(G\). The set \(\langle a \rangle = \{a^k \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}\) of powers of \(a\) is called the <b>cyclic subgroup generated by</b> \(a\). If there is an element \(a \in G\) such that \(\langle a \rangle = G\), we say that \(G\) is a <b>cyclic group</b>. We say that \(a\) is a <b>generator</b> of the cyclic group
</div>
<br>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
Suppose $$G = \mathbf{Z}$$ with the addition operator. For any element $$d \in \mathbf{Z}$$, the set of powers of $$d$$ is the set of all multiples of $$d$$ since the group operation is addition. So $$d+d+d+d+d$$ is the fifth power for example. We see here that $$\langle d \rangle = d \mathbf{Z} = \{nd \ : \ n \in \mathbf{Z}\}$$ is a cyclic subgroup of $$\mathbf{Z}$$. In fact, $$\mathbf{Z}$$ itself is cyclic.

<h4><b>The Order of a Cyclic Subgroup</b></h4>
A cyclic subgroup could be infinite or finite. When the powers of $$a$$ are all distinct, it's infinite. Otherwise, it is not. The following definition formalizes this.
<br>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition 2.2.16
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
The <b>order</b> of the cyclic subgroup generated by \(a\) is called <b>the order of </b>\(a\). We denote the order of \(a\) by \(o(a)\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
When the order of $$a$$ is finite, then two powers of $$a$$ will coincide at some point. Suppose that $$k < l$$, and $$a^k = a^l$$, then $$a^{l-k} = e$$. This implies that some positive integer of $$a$$ is the identity element. Let $$n$$ be the least positive integer such that $$a^n = e$$. This means that $$e, a, a^2,...a^{n-1}$$ are all distinct (Why? TODO). Write $$k = mn + r$$. Therefore,
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 a^{k} &= a^{mn+r} \\
	       &= a^{mn}a^r \\
		   &= e^{m}a^r \\
		   &= a^r
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
This means that $$a^k = a^l$$ if and only if $$k$$ and $$l$$ have the same remainder upon division of $$n$$, that is $$k \equiv l \mod n$$. This leads to the following proposition
<br>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2.2.17
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
If the order of \(a\) is finite, then it is the least positive integer \(n\) such that \(a^n = e\). Furthermore, \(\langle a \rangle = \{a^k \ : \ 0 \leq k < o(a)\}\)
</div>
<br>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
What is the order of $$[5]$$ in $$\phi(14)$$? We know $$[5]^2 = [11]$$, $$[5]^3 = [13]$$ because $$5^3 = 125 \mod 14 = 13$$. $$[5]^4 = [9]$$, $$[5]^5 = 3$$ and finally $$[5]^6 = [1]$$. So the order of $$[5]$$ is 6. 
<br>
<br>
The following result shows that in fact any two cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic!
<br>

<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2.2.20
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(a\) be an element of a group \(G\).
<ol type="a">
	<li>If \(a\) has infinte order, then \(\langle a \rangle\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}\)</li>
	<li>If \(a\) has finite order, then \(\langle a \rangle\) is isomorphic to the group \(\mathbf{Z}_n\)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<br>
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
For $$(a)$$, we want to show this by finding an example of a isomorphism. So define the map $$\varphi \ : \ \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \langle a \rangle$$ by $$\varphi(k) = a^k$$. To show that this map is an isomorphism, we need to show that it is a bijection and also that for any two elements $$a, b \in \mathbf{Z}$$, $$\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)$$ (Definition 2.1.13).
<br>
<br>
To show that it is a bijection, observe that this map is surjective or onto by the definition of $$\langle a \rangle$$. (Recall that that $$\langle a \rangle$$ is of infinite order). It is also injective or 1-1 because all the elements of $$\langle a \rangle$$ (powers of $$a$$) are distinct. Furthermore, see that $$\varphi(k + l) = a^{k+l} = a^ka^k$$. So $$\varphi$$ is an isomorphism.
<br>
<br>
Similarly for $$(b)$$, we want to define an isomorphism. Note here that both $$\mathbf{Z}_n$$ and $$\langle a \rangle$$ have $$n$$ elements so define the map $$\varphi \ : \ \mathbf{Z}_n \rightarrow \langle a \rangle$$ by $$\varphi([k]) = a^k$$ where $$ 0 \leq k \leq n-1$$. In $$\mathbf{Z}_n$$, the addition of $$[k]$$ and $$[l]$$ is $$[r]$$ where $$r$$ is the remainder after dividing $$k+l$$ by $$n$$. While the multiplication in $$\langle a \rangle$$ is given by $$a^ka^l = a^{k+l} = a^r$$ where $$r$$ is also the remainder after dividing $$k+l$$ by $$n$$ as we saw earlier. Therefore $$\varphi$$ is an isomorphism.

<h4><b>Subgroups of Cyclic Groups</b></h4>
Every cyclic group is isomorphic to $$\mathbf{Z}$$ or $$\mathbf{Z}_n$$. Therefore, we'll determine the subgroups of $$\mathbf{Z}$$ and $$\mathbf{Z}_n$$ to determine all the subgroups of cyclic groups.
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2.2.21
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
<ol type="a">
	<li>Let \(H\) be a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}\). Then either \(H = \{0\}\) or there is a unique \(d \in \mathbf{N}\) such that \(H = \langle d \rangle = d\mathbf{Z}\)</li>
	<li>If \(d \in \mathbf{N}\), then \(d\mathbf{Z} \cong \mathbf{Z}\).</li>
	<li>If \(a, b \in \mathbf{N}\), then \(d\mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{Z}\) if and only if \(b\) divides \(a\).</li>
