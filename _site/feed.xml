  <b>Suppose \(A, B \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) are nonempty and bounded above. Find a formula for \(\sup (A \cup B)\) and prove that it is correct.</b>

<p><br />
For the definitions of an upper bound and the least upper bound of a set. See <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">This</a>.
<br /></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \(A, B \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) be nonempty and bounded above. By the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">Axiom of Completeness</a>, \(\sup A\) and \(\sup B\) both exist. We claim that that \(\sup (A \cup B) = \sup (\{\sup A, \sup B\})\). Since \(\sup A\) and \(\sup B\) both exist, then the set \(\{\sup A, \sup B\}\) is nonempty and bounded above. Therefore, \(\sup (A \cup B)\) also exists by the Axiom of Completeness.
<br />
<br />
Without the loss of generality, suppose that \(\sup A \geq \sup B\). If that’s the case, then \(\sup (\{\sup A, \sup B\}) = \sup A\). (Why? because the maximum of the set is the supremum of the set. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bLaGzeTMkY">proof</a> for this is straight forward). So now the goal is to prove that \(\sup (A \cup B) = \sup A\). To do this, we will prove that</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(\sup (A \cup B) \geq \sup A\)</li>
	<li>\(\sup (A \cup B) \leq \sup A\)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first inequality, we want to prove that \(\sup (A \cup B)\) is an upper bound on the set \(A\). First, \(\sup(A \cup B)\) is an upper bound on the set \(A \cup B\) (by the definition of the least upper bound). But we know that \(A \subseteq A \cup B\). Therefore, \(\sup(A \cup B)\) is an upper bound on the set \(A\) as well. Second, we know that \(\sup A\) must be less than or equal to any other upper bound by the definition of the least upper bound. Therefore \(\sup A \leq \sup(A \cup B)\).
<br />
<br />
For the second inequality, suppose for the sake of contradiction that it is not the case that \(\sup (A \cup B) \leq \sup A\). So \(\sup (A \cup B) &gt; \sup A\). This means that \(\sup A\) is not upper bound on the set \(A \cup B\). Therefore, there must exists some element \(b \in B\) such that \(b &gt; \sup A\). But we know by the definition of the least upper bound that \(\sup b \geq b\). So now we have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup A &lt; b &lt; \sup B
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This is a contradiction since we assumed that \(\sup A &gt; \sup B\) and therefore we must have \(\sup (A \cup B) \leq \sup A\) as required. \(\blacksquare\)

  <b>Given sets A and B, define the set \(A + B = \{a + b : a \in A \text{ and } b \in B\}\). Prove that \(\sup A + B = \sup A + \sup B \)</b>
</div>
<p><br />
For the definitions of an upper bound and the least upper bound of a set. See <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">This</a>.
<br /></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \(A\) and \(B\) be sets and let \(A + B\) be the set defined above. We want to prove that \(\sup A+B = \sup A + \sup B\). To do this, we will prove:</p>
<ul> 
	<li>\(\sup (A+B) \leq \sup A + \sup B\).</li> 
	<li>\(\sup (A+B) \geq \sup A + \sup B\).</li>
</ul>
<p>From these two inequalities we will then conclude that \(\sup A+B = \sup A + \sup B\). To prove that \(\sup A+B \leq \sup A + \sup B\), let \(a\) be an arbitrary element in \(A\). Then we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a &amp;\leq \sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Similarly, Let \(b\) be an arbitrary element in \(B\). Then we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
b &amp;\leq \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Adding both inequalities will result in</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a + b &amp;\leq \sup A + \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Since \(a\) and \(b\) were arbitrary, this means that \(\sup A + \sup B\) is an upper bound for \(A + B\). But we know the least upper bound for \(A+B\) is \(\sup A + B\) and by the definition of the least upper bound \(\sup A + B\) must be less than or equal to any other bound on \(A + B\). Therefore we can write,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup (A+B) &amp;\leq \sup A + \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>And this concludes the first part of the proof. To prove condition two, define an arbitrary \(\epsilon &gt; 0\). By <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/05/analysis-least-upper-bound-epsilon.html">lemma 1.3.8</a> we know that there exists some element \(x \in A\) such that,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
x &gt; \sup A - \epsilon/2.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>(Side note: the lemma states that \(\sup A\) is a least upper bound iff for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), there exists some element in \(A\) such that \(a &gt; \sup - \epsilon\) so really any tiny epsilon taken away from \(\sup A\) will render it not a least upper bound anymore)<br />Similarly, there exists an element \(y \in B\) such that,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
y &gt; \sup B - \epsilon/2.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Adding both inequalities we see,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
x + y &gt; \sup A + \sup B - \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>But from part 1 of the proof we know that \(\sup A + \sup B\) is an upper bound for \(A+B\) where we saw that if for any arbitrary elements \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\), we have</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a + b \leq \sup A + \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So we have two things. First \(\sup A + \sup B\) is an upper bound on \(A+B\). Second, we proved above that for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), there exists some elements \(x \in A\) and \(y \in B\) such that \(x + y &gt; \sup A + \sup B - \epsilon\). So by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/05/analysis-least-upper-bound-epsilon.html">lemma 1.3.8</a>, \(\sup A + \sup B\) is a least upper bound for \(A + B\) and so we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup A + \sup B \leq \sup (A + B).
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>as required. \(\blacksquare\)

By lemma 1.3.8 we know that there exists some element \(x \in A\) such that, $$ \begin{align*} x &gt; \sup A - \epsilon/2. \end{align*} $$ (Side note: the lemma states that \(\sup A\) is a least upper bound iff for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), there exists some element in \(A\) such that \(a &gt; \sup - \epsilon\) so really any tiny epsilon taken away from \(\sup A\) will render it not a least upper bound anymore)Similarly, there exists an element \(y \in B\) such that, $$ \begin{align*} y &gt; \sup B - \epsilon/2. \end{align*} $$ Adding both inequalities we see, $$ \begin{align*} x + y &gt; \sup A + \sup B - \epsilon. \end{align*} $$ But from part 1 of the proof we know that \(\sup A + \sup B\) is an upper bound for \(A+B\) where we saw that if for any arbitrary elements \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\), we have $$ \begin{align*} a + b \leq \sup A + \sup B. \end{align*} $$ So we have two things. First \(\sup A + \sup B\) is an upper bound on \(A+B\). Second, we proved above that for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), there exists some elements \(x \in A\) and \(y \in B\) such that \(x + y &gt; \sup A + \sup B - \epsilon\). So by lemma 1.3.8, \(\sup A + \sup B\) is a least upper bound for \(A + B\) and so we must have, $$ \begin{align*} \sup A + \sup B \leq \sup (A + B). \end{align*} $$ as required. \(\blacksquare\) References: Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott Dr. Peyman]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">(1.3.6) The Least Upper Bound of the Sum of Two Sets</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/05/07/analysis-least-upper-bound-sum.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="(1.3.6) The Least Upper Bound of the Sum of Two Sets" /><published>2024-05-07T01:01:36-07:00</published><updated>2024-05-07T01:01:36-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/05/07/analysis-least-upper-bound-sum</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/05/07/analysis-least-upper-bound-sum.html"><![CDATA[<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">

<br /></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \(A\) and \(B\) be sets and let \(A + B\) be the set defined above. We want to prove that \(\sup A+B = \sup A + \sup B\). To do this, we will prove:</p>
<ul> 
	<li>\(\sup (A+B) \leq \sup A + \sup B\).</li> 
	<li>\(\sup (A+B) \geq \sup A + \sup B\).</li>
</ul>
<p>From these two inequalities we will then conclude that \(\sup A+B = \sup A + \sup B\).
<br />
<br />
To prove that \(\sup A+B \leq \sup A + \sup B\), let \(a\) be an arbitrary element in \(A\). Then we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a &amp;\leq \sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Similarly, Let \(b\) be an arbitrary element in \(B\). Then we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
b &amp;\leq \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Adding both inequalities will result in</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a + b &amp;\leq \sup A + \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Since \(a\) and \(b\) were arbitrary, this means that \(\sup A + \sup B\) is an upper bound for \(A + B\). But we know the least upper bound for \(A+B\) is \(\sup A + B\) and by the definition of the least upper bound \(\sup A + B\) must be less than or equal to any other bound on \(A + B\). Therefore we can write,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup (A+B) &amp;\leq \sup A + \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>And this concludes the first part of the proof. To prove condition two, let \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\) be arbitrary elements. We know that by the definition of the least upper bound we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a + b &amp;\leq \sup (A + B).
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Let’s move \(b\) to the other side of the inequality.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - b.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>\(a\) here is an arbitrary element in \(A\) so \(\sup (A + B) - b\) must be an upper bound for \(A\) by the definition of an upper bound. But we know that \(\sup A\) is the least upper bound and the least upper bound is less than or equal to any other bound. Therefore, we can write,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup A &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - b.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We can move swap \(\sup A\) and \(b\) now to see that,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
b &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - \sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>With the same argument we used previously here we can see that \(\sup (A+B) - \sup A\) is an upper bound for \(B\) since \(b\) is arbitrary and we know that the least upper bound is less than or equal to any other bound. Therefore,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup B &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - \sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Re-arranging the terms gets us,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup A + \sup B &amp;\leq \sup (A + B).
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>as required. This concludes the second part of the proof. Therefore, \(\sup A + \sup B \leq \sup (A + B)\) as required.

<h4><b>Additional Notes:</b></h4>
<p>I struggled with this proof because I was trying to figure out in my head how to transition from \(a + b \leq \sup A + \sup B\) to \(\sup (A+B) \leq \sup A + \sup B\) by trying to swap \(a + b\) with \(\sup (A+B)\). But that not how it works! The first statement establishes that \(\sup A + \sup B\) is some upper bound on \(A+B\). But because the least upper bound is always less than or equal than ANY any other then we can just conclude immediately that \(\sup(A+B) \leq \sup A + \sup B\).

What is this statement saying? It’s important to review the definitions in <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">here</a>. Keep these on the side while working on this proof. For a set \(A\) with an upper bound \(s\), \(s\) can be qualified as the least upper bound if and only if “any number smaller than \(s\) is not an upper bound”. In other words, for \(s\) to be the least upper bound, then no matter how tiny \(\epsilon\) is, \(s - \epsilon\) will get disqualified from being an upper bound because we’re guaranteed to find an element in \(A\) that is greater than \(s - \epsilon\). So we can’t make \(s\) any smaller without losing its status of being an upper bound.
<br />
<br /></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>We’ll prove both directions of the statement.</p>
<ul>
	<li>\((\Rightarrow)\) If \(s = \sup A\), then for every choice of \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) there exists an element \(a \in A\) such that \(s - \epsilon &lt; a\). </li>
We are given that \(s = \sup A\). We want to prove that \(s - \epsilon\) can't be an upper bound because if it was, then \(s\) is not the least upper bound.<br />
Consider \(s - \epsilon\) where \(\epsilon\) is chosen arbitrarily. We know by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">condition two</a> of the defintion of the least upper bound that if \(s = \sup A\), then for any upper bound \(b\) we must have 
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
s \leq b.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
This is saying that \(s\) must be less than or equal to any upper bound of \(A\) but we also know that 
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
s \geq s - \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
So \(s - \epsilon\) can not be an upper bound. Since it can not be an upper bound, then there must be an element \(a \in A\) such that \(a &gt; s - \epsilon\). This completes the proof in the right direction.
<br />
<br />
	<li>\((\Leftarrow)\) If it's the case that for every choice of \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), there exists an element \(a \in A\) such that \(s - \epsilon &lt; a\) then \(s = \sup A\).</li>
To prove that \(s = \sup A\), we need to verify the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">two conditions</a> of the least upper bound. We are given that \(s\) is an upper bound for \(A\) so condition one is satisfied. For condition two, let \(\epsilon\) be chosen arbitrarily. We are given that there will always be an element \(a \in A\) such that \(s - \epsilon &lt; a\). This means that for any \(epsilon\), \(s - \epsilon\) is not an upper bound. So for any number less than \(s\), it is impossible for it to be an upper bound. This is precisely condition two  of the least upper bound. Therefore, \(s\) is the least upper bound and we're done. \(\blacksquare\)

Therefore, \(s\) is the least upper bound and we're done. \(\blacksquare\) References: Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The least upper bound for a set after adding a constant</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/05/04/analysis-least-upper-bound-constant.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The least upper bound for a set after adding a constant" /><published>2024-05-04T01:01:36-07:00</published><updated>2024-05-04T01:01:36-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/05/04/analysis-least-upper-bound-constant</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/05/04/analysis-least-upper-bound-constant.html"><![CDATA[<p>This was another proof that I liked.</p>

  <b>Let \(A \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) be nonempty and bounded above. Let \(c \in \mathbf{R}\). Define the set \(A + c\) by \(c + A = \{ c + a: a \in A\}\). Then \(sup(c+A) = c + sup A\).</b>

What is this statement saying? It’s important to review the definitions in <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">here</a>. Keep these on the side while working on this proof. So assuming we have a least upper bound \(\sup A\). If the set was modified such that each element was changed by adding \(c\) to it, then the least upper bound will be \(c + \sup A\). Sounds very reasonable.
<br />
<br />
How do we prove it? Any time we want to prove something about least upper bounds we’ll need to verify both conditions of the definition of an upper bound. From the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">definitions page</a>, we need to verify that \(c + \sup A\) is indeed an upper bound and then prove that it’s the least one.
<br /></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \(A\) be a bounded non-empty set with a least upper bound \(s = \sup A\). Let \(c\) be a constant. Let \(c + A\) be the set \(\{c + a: a \in A\}\). Since \(s\) is an upper bound then we know that for every element \(a \in A\), we have \(a \leq s\). If we add \(c\) to both sides we’ll have \(a + c \leq s + c\). Therefore, we can see that \(c + s\) is also an upper bound for the set \(A + c\).
<br />
<br />
To verify condition two, let \(b\) be an arbitrarily chosen upper bound of the set \(A + c\). This means that \(a + c \leq b\) for every element \(a \in A\). We can re-write the inequality as,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a \leq b - c.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>From this we can conclude that \(b - c\) is an upper bound for \(A\). Earlier we defined \(s\) as the least upper bound for \(A\) so we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
s \leq b - c.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Re-writing this as,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
s + c \leq b
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>shows that \(s + c\) is less than or equal to any chosen upper bound of \(A + c\). This means that \(s + c\) must be the least upper bound of \(A + c\). This verifies condition two of the definition of the least upper bound. \(\blacksquare\)
