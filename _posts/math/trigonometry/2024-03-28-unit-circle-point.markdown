I really liked this idea from the reference video at the bottom of the page. Basically, if we're given some angle like $$\theta = \frac{5\pi}{6}$$ and we want to find out for example $$\cot(\theta)$$, we can approach this by seeing that the denominator is $$6$$ and so we can divide the upper half of the unit circle into 6 equal parts. Upper half only because $$\frac{5\pi}{6} < \pi$$!

We're interested in the 5th part since we want $$\frac{5\pi}{6}$$. The point corresponding to the angle $$\frac{5\pi}{6}$$ has the same y-coordinate of the point corresponding to $$\frac{\pi}{6}$$. It also has the same magnitude of the x-coordinate but the sign is negative.


<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/math/trig/unit-circle-point-1.png" width="50%" class="center"></p>


The coordinates of the point at angle $$\frac{\pi}{6}$$ are $$(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$$ and so the coordinates of the point at $$\frac{5\pi}{6}$$ will be $$(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$$.
