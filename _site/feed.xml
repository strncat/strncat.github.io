<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Homomorphism Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup. Let \(\pi: G \rightarrow G/N\) be a homomorphism and let \(\phi : G \rightarrow H\) be a homomorphism.<br /> 
Let \(K = ker(\phi)\) be a normal subgroup such that \(N \subseteq K\). Then <br />
There exists a homomorphism \(\varphi': G/N \rightarrow H\) with formula

\begin{align*}
\varphi'(aN) = \varphi(a)

$$
and 
$$
\begin{align*}
ker(\varphi') &amp;= K/N = \{aN \ | aN \subseteq K\} \unlhd G/N \\
\phi'(G/N) &amp;= \phi(G) \leq H
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
In a picture, once we have the requirement \(N \subseteq K\) where \(K = ker(\phi)\), then we get this homomorphism \(\varphi'\) between \(H\) and \(G/N\). This new homomorphism \(\phi'\) is unique.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec16/1.png" width="90%" class="center" /></p>

<p>In short, we’re following a recipe to construct a homomorphism. Given a homomorphism \(\varphi \ : \ G \rightarrow H\) and a normal subgroup \(N\) that is a subset of \(ker(\varphi) = K\) (which means that \(\varphi(N) = \{e\}\) since every element in the kernel is sent to the identity). THEN, we get another homomorphism \(\varphi\) from \(G/N\) to \(H\). The homomorphism is given by \(\varphi'(aN) = \varphi(a)\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>(1) First we need to check that \(\varphi'\) is well defined. This means that want to show that if \(aN = bN\) (in \(G/N\)), then \(\varphi'(a) = \varphi'(b)\) which is \(\varphi(a) = \varphi(b)\) in \(H\) by how we defined \(\varphi'\) above. Re-write \(aN = bN\) as</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    aN &amp;= bN \\
	b^{-1}aN &amp;= N.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So \(b^{-1}a \in N\). Now we can apply \(\varphi\) on it to get</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    \varphi(b^{-1}a) &amp;= \varphi(b^{-1})(a) \quad \text{(since $\varphi$ is a homomorphism)} \\
    e &amp;= \varphi(b^{-1})(a) \quad \text{(since $N \subseteq K$)} \\
    \varphi(b) &amp;= (a).
	
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So it’s well defined as we wanted to show. \(\blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
(2) Next, we want to show that it is a homomorphism. To see that observe that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    \varphi'(aN \cdot bN) &amp;= \varphi(abN) \quad \text{(def of quotient function)} \\
	                      &amp;= \varphi(ab) \quad \text{(def of $\varphi'$)} \\
						  &amp;= \varphi(a)\varphi(b) \quad \text{(def of a homomorphism)} \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>On the other hand</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    \varphi'(aN)\varphi'(bN) &amp;= \varphi(a)\varphi(b) \quad \text{(def of $\varphi'$)} \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>And so we’re done. \(\blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
(3) Finally, we need to prove the conclusions of the theorem. The second statements claims that \(\phi'(G/N) = \phi(G)\). But this is true by how we defined \(\varphi'\). For the first statement which claims that \(ker(\varphi') = K/N = \{aN \ | \ aN \subseteq K\}\). First, we know that by the definition of the kernel that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    ker(\varphi') &amp;= \{aN \ | \ \varphi'(aN) = e_H \} \\
	              &amp;= \{aN \ | \ \varphi(a) = e_H \} \quad \text{(by def of $\varphi'$)} \\
				  &amp;= \{aN \ | \ a \in ker(\phi) = K \} \quad \text{($\varphi(a)=e$ so $a$ is in the kernel)} 
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Notice now that \(N\) is a subgroup of \(K\). This means that any coset of \(N\) will be contained in the corresponding coset of \(K\) so \(aN \subseteq aK\). But here it is the trivial coset so \(aK = eK = K\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Isomorphism Theorem</b></h4>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Isomorphism Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup. Let \(\pi: G \rightarrow G/N\) be a homomorphism and let \(\phi : G \rightarrow H\) be a <b>surjective</b> homomorphism.<br /> 
Let \(K = ker(\phi)\) be a normal subgroup such that \(N = K\) (unlike before where \(N \subseteq K\)). Then <br />
There there is a isomorphism \(\varphi': G/N \rightarrow H\) with formula (same as before)
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi'(aN) = \varphi(a)
\end{align*}
$$
Unlike before, now \(\phi'(G/N) = H\) and the kernel \(ker(\varphi') = \{eN\}\) (the trivial coset of \(N\)).
</div>
<p><br />
So we have the same conditions as before except that \(N = K\) and the \(\phi\) is surjective. So we can apply the homomorphism theorem from before and we’ll get the same results as before. That is, a homomorphism \(\phi'\). But now since \(\phi\) is surjective and its image is the same as the image of \(\phi'\), then \(\phi'\) is also surjective. 
<br />
<br />
Moreover, its kernel per the homomorphism theorem is \(\{aN \ | \ aN \subseteq K\}\) (collection of all cosets of \(N\) that are contained in \(K\)). But now \(N = K\). There is only one coset of \(N\) contained in \(N\) which is the trivial coset \(eN\). so \(ker(\phi') = \{eN\}\). This implies that \(\phi'\) is injective. So \(\phi'\) is now a bijection which means that it’s an isomorphism. 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Let \(H = \langle a \rangle\) be a finite cyclic group of order \(n\). </li>
<li>Let \(G = (\mathbf{Z}, +)\). </li>
<li>Let \(N = \mathbf{Z}n \unlhd \mathbf{Z}\) the group of multiples of \(n\) which is a subgroup of \(G = \mathbf{Z}\).</li>
<li>Let \(\phi: \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow H \) be a surjective homomorphism by the formula \(\phi(m) = a^m\)</li>
<li>The kernel of \(\phi\) is \(ker(\phi) = \{m \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ a^m = e\}\). The kernel is the set of all the multiples of the order of \(\langle a \rangle\) so it's \(\mathbf{Z}n\) where \(n\) is the order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying the Isomorphism Theorem, we get a new isomorphism</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi' \ : \ &amp;\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}n \rightarrow H = \langle a \rangle \\
              &amp;[m]_n \rightarrow a^m.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Reminder: \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}n = \mathbf{Z}_n\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Let \(\mathbf{F}^{x} = \mathbf{F} \ \{0\}\). </li>
<li>Let \(GL_n(\mathbf{F}) = \{ A \in Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbf{F})\) such that \(A\) is invertible\(\}\) with matrix multiplication. </li>
<li>Let \(\phi: GL_n(\mathbf{F}) \rightarrow \mathbf{F}^{x} \) be a homomorphism by the formula \(\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)\). Is the determinant surjective? for any number \(a \in \mathbf{F}\), can we find a matrix satisfying such that its determinant is \(a\)? Yes! consider
$$
\begin{align*}
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; 0 &amp; ... &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; ... &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}
$$
The determinant of this matrix is \(a\). So this homomorphism is surjective.
</li>
<li>The kernel of \(\phi\) is the set of invertible matrices such that their determinant is the identity matrix. \(ker(\phi) = \{A \in GL_n(F) \ | \ \det(a) = 1\}\). This set is called the special linear group or \(SL_n(\mathbf{F})\) In fact it is a normal subgroup of \(GL_n(F)\).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Isomorphism Theorem tells us that \(GL_n(\mathbf{F})/SL_n(\mathbf{F})\) is isomorphic to  \(\mathbf{F}^{x}\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 3</b></h4>
<p>We’re going to show that \(S_4 / N \approx S_3\). 
<br />
<br />
To do this, we’re going to produce a homomorphism from \(S_4\) to \(S_3\). But \(S_3\) is isomorphic to \(Sym(X)\) where \(X\) has 3 elements.
<br />
<br />
\(S_4\) is the set of permutations of a 4 element set. There is a trick that we can use to construct interesting homomorphisms out of a permutation group which is to find structures on the set that we’re permuting. For example define \(X\) to be the set of partitions of \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\) into two disjoint subsets of 2 each. So</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
   &amp;\quad \ \quad S_1 \quad \quad S_2 \quad \quad S_3 \\
X &amp;= \{12|34, 13|24, 14|23\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So we have 3 different ways of grouping these 4 elements. Suppose now we have a permutation in \(S_4\) as follows</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So now let’s apply \(g\) on the three elements in \(X\)</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
S_1 &amp;= 12|34 \xrightarrow{g} 23|14 = 14|23 = S_3 \\
S_2 &amp;= 13|24 \xrightarrow{g} 21|34 = 12|34 = S_1 \\
S_3 &amp;= 14|23 \xrightarrow{g} 24|31 = 13|24 = S_2.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So for the first example, we’re given \(12|34\). We’ll look up where each element goes in \(g\). For example 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3, 3 goes 1 and 4 stays fixed. So that’s exactly what we get which is \(S_3\).
<br />
<br />
So the permutation \(g\) sends \(S_1\) to \(S_3\), \(S_2\) to \(S_1\) and \(S_3\) to \(S_2\).</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}

\xrightarrow{\varphi}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Let’s now take another permutation \(g'\) in \(S_4\)</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g' = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
3 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So now let’s apply \(g'\) on the three elements in \(X\)</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
S_1 &amp;= 12|34 \xrightarrow{g} 21|43 = 12|23 = S_1 \\
S_2 &amp;= 13|24 \xrightarrow{g} 31|42 = 13|24 = S_2 \\
S_3 &amp;= 14|23 \xrightarrow{g} 41|32 = 14|23 = S_3.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So \(g'\) just takes \(X\) to itself</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
3 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}

\xrightarrow{\varphi}

\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
=
id \in S_3
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So here are some claims about \(\varphi\)</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(\varphi\) is a homomorphism from \(S_4\) to \(S_3\).</li>
	<li>\(\varphi\) is surjective. Recall that \(|S_4| = 24\) while \(|S_3| = 6\). (We still need to check (homework))</li>
	<li>\(K = ker(\phi)\) is a normal subgroup of \(S_4\). We can further deduce the order of \(K\). How? We know by the Isomorphism Theorem that the quotient group \(S_4/K\) is isomorphic \(S_3\) because \(\varphi\) is a surjective homomorphism and \(K\) is a normal subgroup. This tells us that these two groups have the same size. Since \(K\) is normal, we also know that the quotient group is the number of cosets. But by Lagrange's Theorem we know that \(\frac{|S_4|}{|K|}\) is equal to the number of cosets. So \(\frac{|S_4|}{|K|} = |S_4/K| = |S_3|\). Therefore, we see that \(|K| = 4\).</li>
	<li>In fact \(K = \{e, (1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 4)(2 \ 3), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4)\} \)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice here that we first proved that \(|K| = 4\) before finding the elements in \(K\). It’s just easier to verify that some element is in the kernel rather than finding the elements first.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 4</b></h4>
<p>Suppose that \(n \geq 3\). Let \(D_{2n}\) be the symmetries of regular \(2n\)-gon (even number of vertices.)<br /> 
We already know that if we have a symmetry of an \(n-\)gon, we get a permutation of its vertices. But there are other ways to construct a homomorphism. Consider the following homomorphism</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi \ : \ D_{2n} \rightarrow Sym(X) \approx S_n
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>where \(X\) be the set of diagonals of the polygon. For example, for \(n = 3\), we have 6 vertices. But we let’s think of the diagonals. We have 3 diagonals. Notice here that any symmetry will take a diagonal to another diagonal. If we label the diagonals, then a rotation will take diagonal 1 to diagonal 2 for example and diagonal 2 to diagonal 3 as shown below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec16/2.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>In fact, this homomorphism is surjective.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi \ : \ D_{6} \rightarrow S_3
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>The kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup of \(D_6\) and by the Isomorphism Theorem, the quotient group \(D_6/K\) is isomorphic to \(S_3\). How big is \(K\)? \(D_6\) has 12 elements and \(S_3\) has 6 elements. So \(K\) must have \(2\) elements. The kernel is \(\{e, r^3\}\).

In other words, \(a \sim_H b\) if \(a^{-1}b \in H\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
We claim that \(\sim_H\) is an equivalence relation. [Exercise: Prove it]
<br />
<br />
The equivalence classes are the left cosets \(aH = \{ah \ | \ h \in H\}\). 
<br />
<br />
Now define \(G / H\) to be the collection of left \(H\)-cosets in \(G\) so \(G / H = \{ aH \ | \ a \in G\}\). Define the Quotient function as follows</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi \ : \ &amp;G \rightarrow G / H \\
     &amp;\pi(g) = gH.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So \(\pi\) sends an element to the coset it is contained in. Of course we can do the same thing for right cosets. We need a different notation so we’ll use a backward slash for right cosets \(G \backslash H\). So \(G \backslash H = \{ Ha \ | \ a \in G\}\). The Quotient function is</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi' \ : \ &amp;G \rightarrow G \backslash H \\
     &amp;\pi'(g) = Hg
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) and let \(H = \mathbf{Z}n\) where \(n \geq 0\) (multiples of \(n\)). Then the set of left cosets is</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
G / H &amp;= \{[a]_n \ | \ a \in \mathbf{Z}\} \\
      &amp;= \mathbf{Z}_n
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Side note: Why? so say \(H = \mathbf{Z}3\), then \(H = \{...,-6,-3,0,3,6,9,...\}\) and the left cosets are</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
0 + H, 1 + H, 2 + H, 3 + H, ...
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>For example</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
0 + H &amp;= \{...,-6,-3,0,3,6,9,...\} = [0]_3 \\
1 + H &amp;= \{...,-5,-2,1,4,7,10,...\} = [1]_3 \\
2 + H &amp;= \{...,-4,-1,2,5,8,11,...\} = [2]_3 \\
3 + H &amp;= \{...,-3,0,3,6,9,12,...\} = 0 + H \\
4 + H &amp;= \{...,-2,1,4,7,10,13,...\} = 1 + H \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>From this we see that \(3H = 0H\), \(4H = 1H\) and so on. There are exactly 3 distinct left cosets. These three left cosets are exactly \(Z_3 = \{[0], [1], [2]\}\).
<br />
<br />
So now we see that \(G / H = \mathbf{Z}_n\). This is a group. In fact \(\pi \ : \ \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}n\) is a homomorphism.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Quotient Function</b></h4>
<p>The question now is if we can do this in general. If we have a group \(G\) and a subgroup \(H \leq G\). We want to put a group structure on the set of left \(H\)-cosets, \(G / H\) such that \(\pi \ : \ G \rightarrow G / H\) is a homomorphism? This is called the “Quotient Group”.
<br />
<br />
Also if we make that happen and \(\pi\) is a homomorphism. What would the kernel of \(\pi\) be? By definition:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
ker(\pi) &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ \pi(g) = e_{G/H}\} \\
         &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = e_{G/H}\} \quad \text{(By def, $\pi(a) = aH$)} \\
         &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = \pi(e_G)\} \quad \text{($\pi$ is a homomorphism so $\pi(e_G) = e_{G/H}$)} \\
         &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = eH\} \quad \text{(by def of $\pi$ again)} \\
		 &amp;= H.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>But we also know that kernels are normal subgroups so this means that \(H\) must be a normal subgroup. So if we make \(\pi\) a homomorphism, then we’ll see that \(H\) is actually a normal subgroup. [Is this right?]
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Quotient Group</b></h4>
<p>Now suppose we have a group \(G\) and a normal subgroup \(N\). Define \(G/N\) to be the set of all left cosets of \(N\) so \(G/N = \{ aN \ | \ a \in G \}\). In fact since \(N\) is normal, the left cosets are the right cosets so we don’t need to say left or right in the definition. Let’s also define a group operation on the group \(G/N\).</p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup. Define the operation on \(G/N\) by
$$
\begin{align*}
aN \cdot bN = (ab)N
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
The goal is to show that \((G / N, \cdot)\) is a group. But first we need to show that the operation we defined is well-defined (We also want to show that this operation is a homomorphism later). So we need to show that if \(aN = a'N\) and \(bN = b'N\), then \((ab)N = (a'b')N\).
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof (well-defined)</b>
<br />
Since \(aN = a'N\), then \(a'\) is in the coset \(aN\) and we can write \(a' = an_1\) for some \(n_1 \in N\). Similarly, \(bN = b'N\) so we can write \(b' = bn_2\) for some \(n_2 \in N\). We want to show that \(a'b' = abn\) for some \(n \in N\). Now,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a'b' &amp;= an_1bn_2 \\
     &amp;= a(bb^{-1})n_1bn_2 \\
	 &amp;= (ab)(b^{-1}n_1bn_2)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So now we want to show that \(b^{-1}n_1bn_2 \in N\). We know that \(N\) is a normal subgroup. So if we conjugate \(n\) by \(b^{-1}\), then we know that \(b^{-1}nb \in N\) because \(N\) is normal. Moreover, \((b^{-1}nb)(n_2) \in N\) since \(N\) is a subgroup. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof (\((G/N, \cdot)\) is a group)</b>
<br />
To show this, we need to verify the group properties</p>
<ol>
	<li>Associative: We want to show that \((aN \cdot bN) \cdot cN = aN \cdot (bN \cdot cN)\)
		<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		(aN \cdot bN) \cdot cN &amp;= abN \cdot cN \\
		                       &amp;= (ab)cN \\
							   &amp;= a(bc)N \quad \text{(multiplication is associative)} \\
							   &amp;= aN \cdot (bN \cdot cN).
		\end{align*}
		$$
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>Identity: The identity element is \((eN)\)</li>
	<li>Inverses: We want to show that \((aN)^{-1}\) is an inverse of \(aN\).</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, \((G/N, \cdot)\) is a group.
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof (homomorphism)</b>
<br />
Next we want to show that \(\pi: G \rightarrow G/N\) is a homomorphism with kernel \(ker(\pi) = N\). Recall that \(\pi(a) = aN\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = D_4 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j\}\). We established the identities \(r^4 = e = j^2\) and \(jr = r^{-1}j\). We first claim that \(N = \langle r^2 \rangle = \{e, r^2\}\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\). Why? For any \(g \in D_4\), we have \(g r^2 g^{-1} \in \langle r^2 \rangle\).
<br />
<br />
Since \(N\) is normal, then we can form the quotient group \(G / N\) where</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	G/N = D_4/N = \{eN, rN, jN, rjN\}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Note that the other possibilities end up being the same as one of the four cosets above. For example \(r^2N = eN\) and \(r^3N = rN\). Note also that this matches Lagrange’s Theorem. By Lagrange, we expect to have \(|G|/|N|\) cosets. \(|G| = 8\) and \(|N| = 2\) so we indeed have 4 elements.
<br />
<br />
Since \(D_4/N\) has 4 elements, then we expect this group to be isomorphic to either the cyclic group of order 4 or the non-cyclic one. How do we know? We can calculate the order of the elements in the group. If there is an element of order 4, then it’s cyclic. If there is not, then it can’t be cyclic. For example \((rN)^2 = r^2N = eN\). Why? \(r^2N\) is the coset</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\{r^2(e), r^2(r^2)\} = \{r^2, e\} = eN.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>What about \((jN)^2\)?</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(jN)^2=j^2N = eN.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Next, \((rjN)^2 = (rj)^2N\) But \(rj\) is a flip so it’s square is \(e\) and so \((rjN)^2 = eN\). So every element’s square is the identity and no element has order 4. So it’s isomorphic to \(V\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<p>Now consider \(D_6 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j, r^5j\}\). Consider \(N = \langle r^3 \rangle = \{e, r^3\}\) which is a normal subgroup of \(D_6\). Why is it normal? Because if we conjugate it with any element from \(D_6\), we will get the same set</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	r^k r^3 r^{-k} &amp;= r^3 \\
	rj r^3 (rj)^{-1} &amp;= jr^{-1} r^3 r j^{-1} = r^3 \\
	....
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is actually because \(r^3g = gr^3\) for all \(g \in G\). This is a property of \(r^3\). (in this case \(r^3\) is called “central”). Moreover, \(G/N\) will have \(|G|/|H| = 6\) cosets.</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	G/N = D_6 / \langle r^3 \rangle = \{eN, rN, r^2N, jN, rjN, r^2jN\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>As a reminder, because \(N\) is a normal subgroup, \(G/N\) is a group. It’s a group of order 6. There are two groups of order 6. The abelian cyclic one and \(D_3\) which is isomorphic to \(S_3\). To determine which one, we need to find the order of the elements. Any flip will have order two and so it turns out that \(jN, rjN, r^2jN\) all have order 2. \(eN\) has order 1. For the rest</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(rN)^3 = r^3N = \{(r^3)e, (r^3)r^3\} = \{e, r^3\} = eN.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>In fact, \(r^2N\) has order 3 as well. So none of the elements have order 6 and so this group is not cyclic. It is in fact isomorphic to \(D_3\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 3</b></h4>
<p>Now consider \(G = (\mathbf{R}, +)\) and \(H = (\mathbf{Z}, +)\). \(G\) is abelian. Therefore, all of its subgroups are normal and \(H\) is normal. Now let’s form the quotient group as follows</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	G/H = \mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z} = \{a + \mathbf{Z} \ | \ a \in \mathbf{R}\}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(a + \mathbf{Z} = [a] = \{a + n \ | \ n \in \mathbf{Z}\}\) is a \(\mathbf{Z}\) coset of \(a\). For example if \(a = \frac{1}{3}\), then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\frac{1}{3} + \mathbf{Z} = \{...,-1 + \frac{1}{3}, 0 + \frac{1}{3}, 1 + \frac{1}{3}, ...\} \subseteq \mathbf{R}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(G/H\) is a group under addition where \([a] + [b] = [a + b]\). This group is abelian. What is this group isomorphic to? 
<br />
<br />
Let \(T\) be the set of rotations around the \(z\) axis so \(T = \{r_{\theta} = Rot_{e_3}(\theta) \ | \ \theta \in \mathbf{R}\}\). This is a subgroup of \(SO(3)\). Note here that \(r_{\theta + 2\pi n} = r_{\theta}\). It turns out that \(\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}\) is isomorphic to \(T\). The isomorphism is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow T \\
	[x] &amp;\rightarrow r_{2\pi x}
	\end{align*}
	$$

<h4><b>Example 4</b></h4>
<p>Let \(F\) be a field. (\(F = \mathbf{R}\) or \(\mathbf{C}\) or \(\mathbf{Z}p\), \(p\) is prime). Now let</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	GL_n(F) = \{ A \in Mat_{n \times n}(F) \ | \ A^{-1} \text{ exists }\}

<p>Why is this a normal subgroup? because you can pull out scalars in matrix multiplication so \(A^{-1}cA = cA^{-1}A = cI\).
We can form the quotient group</p>

<h4><b>Symmetric Groups</b></h4>
<p>We want to know what the normal subgroups of symmetric groups are. In order to do so, we want to see what happens if we conjugate a permutation \(\tau\) with element so \(\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\)?
<br />
<br />
In turns out in symmetric groups, there is a way to understand conjugation. We actually have a formula. This formula is called the <b>cycle conjugation formula</b>. Given \(\tau = (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... a_k) \in S_n\) where \(\tau\) is a permutation consisting of a \(k-\)cycle with \(a_1,a_2... \in \{1,2,....,n\}\). Then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} &amp;= (b_1 \ b_2 \ ... b_k) \quad \text{where } b_i = \sigma(a_i) \\
	                                         &amp;= (\sigma(a_1) \ \sigma(a_2) \ ...\ \sigma(a_k))
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So we actually get another \(k\) cycle.
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We want to show that 
\(\sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} = (\sigma(a_1) \ \sigma(a_2) \ ... \ \sigma(a_k))\). We will compute the new permutation directly. Let \(x \in \{1,2,...,n\}\). It turns out that there are two cases.
<br />
<br />
Case 1: \(x = \sigma(a_i)\):<br />
So now we’ll apply the permutation on \(x\). First we apply \(\sigma^{-1}\) but since \(x = \sigma(a_i)\), then we will just get \(a_i\). Next, we’ll apply the cycle and here we’ll get \(a_{i+1}\) since it’s a cycle. Lastly, we need to apply \(\sigma\). So we get \(\sigma(a_{i+1})\). (There is a subtlety here because \(a_{i+1}\) for \(i = k\), is \(i = 1\). To fix this, we’ll let \(a_{k+1} = 1\) or just have two cases). So in summary:</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} (x) &amp;= \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} (\sigma(a_i)) \\
	                                               &amp;= \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) (a_i) \\
												   &amp;=  \begin{cases} a_{j+1} \quad &amp;\text{if } j \neq k \\ a_1 \quad \quad &amp;\text{if } j = k\end{cases}

	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Case 2: \(x \neq \sigma(a_i)\) for any \(i\)<br />
Apply \(\sigma^{-1}\) to get \(\sigma^{-1}(x) \neq a_i\) for any \(i\). This means that the cycle actually doesn’t do anything to \(x\). So \(x\) is in fact fixed. So</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} (x) &amp;= \sigma ( \sigma^{-1} (a_i)) \\
	                                               &amp;= x.

	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>From Case 1 and Case 2, we see that \(\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\) is the \(k\)-cycle \((\sigma(a_1) \ \sigma(a_2) \ ...\ \sigma(a_k))\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Cycle Conjugation Formula Application</b></h4>
<p>Suppose we have an element \(\tau = \tau_1 \tau_2 ... \tau_r \in S_n\) where each \(\tau_i\) is a cycle. Now suppose we have another element \(\sigma\). Then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} &amp;= \sigma \tau_1 \tau_2 ... \tau_r \sigma^{-1} \\
	                        &amp;= \sigma \tau_1 (\sigma^{-1}\sigma) \tau_2 (\sigma^{-1}\sigma) ... (\sigma^{-1}\sigma) \tau_r \sigma^{-1} \\
							&amp;= (\sigma \tau_1 \sigma^{-1}) (\sigma \tau_2 \sigma^{-1}) \sigma ... \sigma^{-1} (\sigma \tau_r \sigma^{-1}) \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So if we have a permutation \(\tau\) that has a cycle decomposition and therefore a cycle type (cycle decomposition meaning that it can be decomposed into disjoint cycles). Then if we conjugate the permutation, the conjugate will also have exactly the same cycle type as \(\tau\). So two facts
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Fact
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
\(\forall \ \sigma, \tau \in S_n\), \(\tau\) and \(\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\) have the same cycle type.
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Fact
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(\tau, \tau' \in S_n\) have the same cycle type. Then \(\tau' = \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\) for some \(\sigma \in S_n\). 
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<p>For example, let \(\sigma = (1 \ 3 \ 4 \ 7 \ 2 \ 5) \in S_9\) and let \(\tau = (2 \ 9)(1 \ 8 \ 7)\). If we conjugate \(\tau\) with \(\sigma\), then we know by the previous fact that the cycle type will remain the same. This means that we will get a 3-cycle followed by a 2-cycle \((a_1 \ a_2 \ a_3)(a_4 \ a_5)\). Furthermore, to figure out these new numbers. We just apply sigma on \(\tau\), meaning that we permute the elements in \(\tau\) according to \(\sigma\). For example, \(\sigma\) sends 2 to 5. so we’ll replace 2 with 5 in \(\tau\). \(\sigma\) doesn’t do anything to 6 so it just stays and so on.</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sigma &amp;= (1 \ 3 \ 4 \ 7 \ 2 \ 5) \\
	\tau &amp;= (2 \ 9)(1 \ 8 \ 7) \\
	\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} &amp;= (5 \ 6)(3 \ 8 \ 2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We can also ask, given \(\tau\) and given \(\tau' = (5 \ 6)(3 \ 8 \ 2)\). How can we produce \(\sigma\) such that \(\tau' = \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\)? For this, it is easier to right \(\sigma\) using the two notation. So now we will look at \(\tau\) see that the first element is 2 and 2 goes to 5 in \(\tau'\). The second element is 9 and to goes to 6 in \(\tau'\) (position wise) and so. Therefore</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\tau &amp;= (2 \ 9)(1 \ 8 \ 7) \\
	\tau' &amp;= (5 \ 6)(3 \ 8 \ 2) \\
	\sigma &amp;= 
	\begin{pmatrix}
	1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\
	3 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 9 &amp; 6 &amp; 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 7
	\end{pmatrix}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Notice that for the other elements 3. We don’t care where it goes as long it goes somewhere. As a reminder, \(\sigma\) is not unique and there could be many \(\sigma\)’s such that \(\tau = \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = S_3\) and \(N = \{e, (1 \ 2 \ 3), (1 \ 3\ 2)\} \leq S_3\).
<br />
<br />
Observation: A subgroup \(H \leq S_n\) is normal if and only if whenever \(g \in H\), then so is every element with the same cycle type as \(g\). 
<br />
<br />
Based on this, \(H = \{e, (1 \ 2)\} \leq S_3\). \(H\) is not normal since it doesn’t have all the elements of the same cycle type. Other normal subgroups of \(S_n\) are \(\{e\}\), \(A_n = ker(sgn)\) even permutations. And if \(n = 4\), \(K = \{e, (1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4), (1 \ 4),(2 \ 3)\}\).

Define the Quotient function as follows $$ \begin{align*} \pi \ : \ &amp;G \rightarrow G / H \\ &amp;\pi(g) = gH. \end{align*} $$ So \(\pi\) sends an element to the coset it is contained in. Of course we can do the same thing for right cosets. We need a different notation so we’ll use a backward slash for right cosets \(G \backslash H\). So \(G \backslash H = \{ Ha \ | \ a \in G\}\). The Quotient function is $$ \begin{align*} \pi' \ : \ &amp;G \rightarrow G \backslash H \\ &amp;\pi'(g) = Hg \end{align*} $$ Example Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) and let \(H = \mathbf{Z}n\) where \(n \geq 0\) (multiples of \(n\)). Then the set of left cosets is $$ \begin{align*} G / H &amp;= \{[a]_n \ | \ a \in \mathbf{Z}\} \\ &amp;= \mathbf{Z}_n \end{align*} $$ Side note: Why? so say \(H = \mathbf{Z}3\), then \(H = \{...,-6,-3,0,3,6,9,...\}\) and the left cosets are $$ \begin{align*} 0 + H, 1 + H, 2 + H, 3 + H, ... \end{align*} $$ For example $$ \begin{align*} 0 + H &amp;= \{...,-6,-3,0,3,6,9,...\} = [0]_3 \\ 1 + H &amp;= \{...,-5,-2,1,4,7,10,...\} = [1]_3 \\ 2 + H &amp;= \{...,-4,-1,2,5,8,11,...\} = [2]_3 \\ 3 + H &amp;= \{...,-3,0,3,6,9,12,...\} = 0 + H \\ 4 + H &amp;= \{...,-2,1,4,7,10,13,...\} = 1 + H \\ \end{align*} $$ From this we see that \(3H = 0H\), \(4H = 1H\) and so on. There are exactly 3 distinct left cosets. These three left cosets are exactly \(Z_3 = \{[0], [1], [2]\}\). So now we see that \(G / H = \mathbf{Z}_n\). This is a group. In fact \(\pi \ : \ \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}n\) is a homomorphism. Quotient Function The question now is if we can do this in general. If we have a group \(G\) and a subgroup \(H \leq G\). We want to put a group structure on the set of left \(H\)-cosets, \(G / H\) such that \(\pi \ : \ G \rightarrow G / H\) is a homomorphism? This is called the “Quotient Group”. Also if we make that happen and \(\pi\) is a homomorphism. What would the kernel of \(\pi\) be? By definition: $$ \begin{align*} ker(\pi) &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ \pi(g) = e_{G/H}\} \\ &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = e_{G/H}\} \quad \text{(By def, $\pi(a) = aH$)} \\ &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = \pi(e_G)\} \quad \text{($\pi$ is a homomorphism so $\pi(e_G) = e_{G/H}$)} \\ &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = eH\} \quad \text{(by def of $\pi$ again)} \\ &amp;= H. \end{align*} $$ But we also know that kernels are normal subgroups so this means that \(H\) must be a normal subgroup. So if we make \(\pi\) a homomorphism, then we’ll see that \(H\) is actually a normal subgroup. [Is this right?] Quotient Group Now suppose we have a group \(G\) and a normal subgroup \(N\). Define \(G/N\) to be the set of all left cosets of \(N\) so \(G/N = \{ aN \ | \ a \in G \}\). In fact since \(N\) is normal, the left cosets are the right cosets so we don’t need to say left or right in the definition. Let’s also define a group operation on the group \(G/N\). Definition Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup. Define the operation on \(G/N\) by $$ \begin{align*} aN \cdot bN = (ab)N \end{align*} $$ The goal is to show that \((G / N, \cdot)\) is a group. But first we need to show that the operation we defined is well-defined (We also want to show that this operation is a homomorphism later). So we need to show that if \(aN = a'N\) and \(bN = b'N\), then \((ab)N = (a'b')N\). Proof (well-defined) Since \(aN = a'N\), then \(a'\) is in the coset \(aN\) and we can write \(a' = an_1\) for some \(n_1 \in N\). Similarly, \(bN = b'N\) so we can write \(b' = bn_2\) for some \(n_2 \in N\). We want to show that \(a'b' = abn\) for some \(n \in N\). Now, $$ \begin{align*} a'b' &amp;= an_1bn_2 \\ &amp;= a(bb^{-1})n_1bn_2 \\ &amp;= (ab)(b^{-1}n_1bn_2) \end{align*} $$ So now we want to show that \(b^{-1}n_1bn_2 \in N\). We know that \(N\) is a normal subgroup. So if we conjugate \(n\) by \(b^{-1}\), then we know that \(b^{-1}nb \in N\) because \(N\) is normal. Moreover, \((b^{-1}nb)(n_2) \in N\) since \(N\) is a subgroup. \(\ \blacksquare\) Proof (\((G/N, \cdot)\) is a group) To show this, we need to verify the group properties Associative: We want to show that \((aN \cdot bN) \cdot cN = aN \cdot (bN \cdot cN)\) $$ \begin{align*} (aN \cdot bN) \cdot cN &amp;= abN \cdot cN \\ &amp;= (ab)cN \\ &amp;= a(bc)N \quad \text{(multiplication is associative)} \\ &amp;= aN \cdot (bN \cdot cN). \end{align*} $$ Identity: The identity element is \((eN)\) Inverses: We want to show that \((aN)^{-1}\) is an inverse of \(aN\). Therefore, \((G/N, \cdot)\) is a group. Proof (homomorphism) Next we want to show that \(\pi: G \rightarrow G/N\) is a homomorphism with kernel \(ker(\pi) = N\). Recall that \(\pi(a) = aN\). Example 1 Let \(G = D_4 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j\}\). We established the identities \(r^4 = e = j^2\) and \(jr = r^{-1}j\). We first claim that \(N = \langle r^2 \rangle = \{e, r^2\}\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\). Why? For any \(g \in D_4\), we have \(g r^2 g^{-1} \in \langle r^2 \rangle\). Since \(N\) is normal, then we can form the quotient group \(G / N\) where $$ \begin{align*} G/N = D_4/N = \{eN, rN, jN, rjN\}. \end{align*} $$ Note that the other possibilities end up being the same as one of the four cosets above. For example \(r^2N = eN\) and \(r^3N = rN\). Note also that this matches Lagrange’s Theorem. By Lagrange, we expect to have \(|G|/|N|\) cosets. \(|G| = 8\) and \(|N| = 2\) so we indeed have 4 elements. Since \(D_4/N\) has 4 elements, then we expect this group to be isomorphic to either the cyclic group of order 4 or the non-cyclic one. How do we know? We can calculate the order of the elements in the group. If there is an element of order 4, then it’s cyclic. If there is not, then it can’t be cyclic. For example \((rN)^2 = r^2N = eN\). Why? \(r^2N\) is the coset $$ \begin{align*} \{r^2(e), r^2(r^2)\} = \{r^2, e\} = eN. \end{align*} $$ What about \((jN)^2\)? $$ \begin{align*} (jN)^2=j^2N = eN. \end{align*} $$ Next, \((rjN)^2 = (rj)^2N\) But \(rj\) is a flip so it’s square is \(e\) and so \((rjN)^2 = eN\). So every element’s square is the identity and no element has order 4. So it’s isomorphic to \(V\). Example 2 Now consider \(D_6 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j, r^5j\}\). Consider \(N = \langle r^3 \rangle = \{e, r^3\}\) which is a normal subgroup of \(D_6\). Why is it normal? Because if we conjugate it with any element from \(D_6\), we will get the same set $$ \begin{align*} r^k r^3 r^{-k} &amp;= r^3 \\ rj r^3 (rj)^{-1} &amp;= jr^{-1} r^3 r j^{-1} = r^3 \\ .... \end{align*} $$ This is actually because \(r^3g = gr^3\) for all \(g \in G\). This is a property of \(r^3\). (in this case \(r^3\) is called “central”). Moreover, \(G/N\) will have \(|G|/|H| = 6\) cosets. $$ \begin{align*} G/N = D_6 / \langle r^3 \rangle = \{eN, rN, r^2N, jN, rjN, r^2jN\} \end{align*} $$ As a reminder, because \(N\) is a normal subgroup, \(G/N\) is a group. It’s a group of order 6. There are two groups of order 6. The abelian cyclic one and \(D_3\) which is isomorphic to \(S_3\). To determine which one, we need to find the order of the elements. Any flip will have order two and so it turns out that \(jN, rjN, r^2jN\) all have order 2. \(eN\) has order 1. For the rest $$ \begin{align*} (rN)^3 = r^3N = \{(r^3)e, (r^3)r^3\} = \{e, r^3\} = eN. \end{align*} $$ In fact, \(r^2N\) has order 3 as well. So none of the elements have order 6 and so this group is not cyclic. It is in fact isomorphic to \(D_3\). Example 3 Now consider \(G = (\mathbf{R}, +)\) and \(H = (\mathbf{Z}, +)\). \(G\) is abelian. Therefore, all of its subgroups are normal and \(H\) is normal. Now let’s form the quotient group as follows $$ \begin{align*} G/H = \mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z} = \{a + \mathbf{Z} \ | \ a \in \mathbf{R}\}. \end{align*} $$ \(a + \mathbf{Z} = [a] = \{a + n \ | \ n \in \mathbf{Z}\}\) is a \(\mathbf{Z}\) coset of \(a\). For example if \(a = \frac{1}{3}\), then $$ \begin{align*} \frac{1}{3} + \mathbf{Z} = \{...,-1 + \frac{1}{3}, 0 + \frac{1}{3}, 1 + \frac{1}{3}, ...\} \subseteq \mathbf{R} \end{align*} $$ \(G/H\) is a group under addition where \([a] + [b] = [a + b]\). This group is abelian. What is this group isomorphic to? Let \(T\) be the set of rotations around the \(z\) axis so \(T = \{r_{\theta} = Rot_{e_3}(\theta) \ | \ \theta \in \mathbf{R}\}\). This is a subgroup of \(SO(3)\). Note here that \(r_{\theta + 2\pi n} = r_{\theta}\). It turns out that \(\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}\) is isomorphic to \(T\). The isomorphism is $$ \begin{align*} \mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow T \\ [x] &amp;\rightarrow r_{2\pi x} \end{align*} $$ Example 4 Let \(F\) be a field. (\(F = \mathbf{R}\) or \(\mathbf{C}\) or \(\mathbf{Z}p\), \(p\) is prime). Now let $$ \begin{align*} GL_n(F) = \{ A \in Mat_{n \times n}(F) \ | \ A^{-1} \text{ exists }\} \end{align*} $$ where the product is matrix multiplication. A normal subgroup here is $$ \begin{align*} H = \{cI, c \in F^{x}\} \quad \text{ (where } F^{x} = F - \{0\}). \end{align*} $$ Why is this a normal subgroup? because you can pull out scalars in matrix multiplication so \(A^{-1}cA = cA^{-1}A = cI\). We can form the quotient group $$ \begin{align*} GL_{n}(F) / H = PGL_n(F) \quad \quad \text{ (The Projective Linear Group) } \end{align*} $$ Symmetric Groups We want to know what the normal subgroups of symmetric groups are. In order to do so, we want to see what happens if we conjugate a permutation \(\tau\) with element so \(\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\)? In turns out in symmetric groups, there is a way to understand conjugation. We actually have a formula. This formula is called the cycle conjugation formula. Given \(\tau = (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... a_k) \in S_n\) where \(\tau\) is a permutation consisting of a \(k-\)cycle with \(a_1,a_2... \in \{1,2,....,n\}\). Then $$ \begin{align*} \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} &amp;= (b_1 \ b_2 \ ... b_k) \quad \text{where } b_i = \sigma(a_i) \\ &amp;= (\sigma(a_1) \ \sigma(a_2) \ ...\ \sigma(a_k)) \end{align*} $$ So we actually get another \(k\) cycle. Proof We want to show that \(\sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} = (\sigma(a_1) \ \sigma(a_2) \ ... \ \sigma(a_k))\). We will compute the new permutation directly. Let \(x \in \{1,2,...,n\}\). It turns out that there are two cases. Case 1: \(x = \sigma(a_i)\): So now we’ll apply the permutation on \(x\). First we apply \(\sigma^{-1}\) but since \(x = \sigma(a_i)\), then we will just get \(a_i\). Next, we’ll apply the cycle and here we’ll get \(a_{i+1}\) since it’s a cycle. Lastly, we need to apply \(\sigma\). So we get \(\sigma(a_{i+1})\). (There is a subtlety here because \(a_{i+1}\) for \(i = k\), is \(i = 1\). To fix this, we’ll let \(a_{k+1} = 1\) or just have two cases). So in summary: $$ \begin{align*} \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} (x) &amp;= \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} (\sigma(a_i)) \\ &amp;= \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) (a_i) \\ &amp;= \begin{cases} a_{j+1} \quad &amp;\text{if } j \neq k \\ a_1 \quad \quad &amp;\text{if } j = k\end{cases}]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lecture 14: Lagrange’s Theorem, Order Theorem &amp;amp; Equivalence Relations</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/06/math417-14-lagrange-order-equivalence.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lecture 14: Lagrange’s Theorem, Order Theorem &amp;amp; Equivalence Relations" /><published>2025-02-06T00:01:36-08:00</published><updated>2025-02-06T00:01:36-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/06/math417-14-lagrange-order-equivalence</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/06/math417-14-lagrange-order-equivalence.html"><![CDATA[<p>Last time, we studied <b>Lagrange’s Theorem</b> which stated that given a finite group \(G\) and a subgroup \(H\) of \(G\), then \(|H|\) divides \(|G|\). Moreover, \(|H| / |G|\) is the number of \(H-\) left cosets in \(G\). In fact, this number was defined to be the index of a group \([G : H]\). So</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
[G : H] = \frac{|H|}{|G|}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>As a consequence, this led to the <b>Order Theorem</b> which stated that if \(G\) was a finite group, then for any \(g \in G\), \(o(g)\) divides \(|G|\). 
<br />
<br />
But now as we see, both theorems are stated for finite groups \(G\) and we know from last lecture that the index of a group can be still defined even if \(G\) is infinite. So this led to the generalized version of Lagrange Theorem as follows:
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br /></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Generalized Lagrange Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G \geq H \geq K\). Then for any \([G: K] = [G : H] [H : K]\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Note here that if \(K\) is the trivial subgroup so \(K = \{e\}\), then \([H:\{e\}] = |H|\). The cosets of the trivial subgroups have size 1 so we’re dividing \(H\) isto subsets of size 1 and therefore we get back the earlier Lagrange’s Theorem
<br />
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Suppose we have \(\mathbf{Z} \geq \mathbf{Z_3} \geq \mathbf{Z}_{12}\) where \(G = \mathbf{Z}\), \(H = \mathbf{Z}_{3}\) and \(K = \mathbf{Z}_{12}\). We know that \([\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}] = 12\) and \([\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{3}] = 3\) so</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
[\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}] = [\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{3}]  [\mathbf{Z}_{3} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}] \\
12 = 3[\mathbf{Z}_{3} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}]
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>From this we can deduce that the index of \(\mathbf{Z}_{12}\) inside \(\mathbf{Z}_3\) is 4.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof of Generalized Lagrange</b></h4>
<p>\([H: K]\) is the number of left \(K\)-cosets inside \(H\). So \(aK \subseteq H\). Observe that for any \(aH\), the number of left \(K\)-cosets in \(aH\) is equal to \([H : K]\). Consider the bijection</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
H &amp;\rightarrow aH \\
h &amp;\rightarrow ah
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Then \(hk\) under this bijection will be \(ahK\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(D_4 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j\}\). Consider:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
H &amp;= \langle r^2, j \rangle = \{e, r^2, j, r^2j\} \\
K &amp;= \langle r^2 \rangle = \{e, r^2\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Then the index \([G : H] = \frac{|H|}{|G|} = 2\) which is the number of \(H\)-left cosets in \(G\). Similarly, \([H : K] = 2\) which is the number of \(K-\) left cosets in \(H\). For example</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
eH &amp;= \{e, r^2, j, r^2j\} \ | \ eK = \{e, r^2\}, \ jK = \{j, r^2j\} \\
rH &amp;= \{r, r^3, rj, r^3j\} \ | \ rK = \{r, r^3\}, \ rjK = \{rj, r^3\}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>If you look at \(eH\), observe that it contains both \(K\)-cosets and if you look at \(rH\), you’ll see that it also contains both of the \(K\) cosets.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Order Theorem</b></h4>
<p>Back to the Order Theorem. For example, for \(|G| = 12\), the order of the elements inside \(G\) are \(o(g) \in \{1,2,3,4,6,12\}\). The question is do we know if there must be a subgroup of order 6? 4? what about 2? For 2, if the order of the group is even, then we must have an element with order 2. To see why, we have the Even Order Theorem as follows:
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br /></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Even Order Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
If \(|G| = n\) and \(n\) is even, then there exists a \(g \in G\) with \(o(g) = 2\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Observe that if \(a \in G\), then \(a^2 = 2\) if and only if \(a^{-1} = a\). In this case, the order must either be 1 or 2 so \(o(a) \in \{1,2\}\). Now, let \(a \in G\). For each \(a\), produce a subset \(C\) such that \(C = \{a, a^{-1}\}\). This is a subset of \(G\) of order 1 or 2 depending on whether \(a = a^{-1}\). 
<br />
<br />
Claim: For \(\{a, a^{-1}\}\) and \(C' = \{b, b^{-1}\}\). Either \(C = C'\) or \(C \cap C' = \emptyset\). Moreover</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\bigcup_{a \in G} \{a, a^{-1}\} = G.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>The union of all these subsets is \(G\). So we get a partition of the set \(G\) into pairwise disjoint subsets of size 1 or 2. So \(n = |G| = r + 2s\). where \(r\) is the number of subsets \(\{a, a^{-1}\}\) of size 1 and \(s\) is the number of subsets \(\{a, a^{-1}\}\) of size \(2\). Notice here that \(r\) is counting all the elements such that each element is its own inverse. So \(r = |\{a \in G \ | \ a^2 = e\}|\). In fact, \(r\) is the number of elements in \(G\) of order 1 or 2. 
<br />
<br />
So we showed that \(n = |G| = r + 2s\) but by assumption, \(n\) is even and since it’s even then 2 divides \(n\). So 2 must divide \(r + 2s\). Therefore, \(2\) must divide \(r\). So \(r\) is even. We also know that \(r\) is at least 1 because the identity element has order 1. Therefore, there must exist at least another element whose order is 2. So there exists a \(g \in G\) such that \(o(g) = 2\). \(\ \blacksquare\).
<br />
<br />
There is a generalization of this theorem that we’ll prove later. But if \(p\) is prime and it divides \(|G|\), then there exists an element of order \(p\).
<br />
<br /></p>

<h4><b>Equivalence Relations</b></h4>
<p>Review of equivalence relations</p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
A relation on a set \(X\) is a subset \(R \subseteq X \times X\). We write \(a \sim b\) for \((a,b) \in R\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
For example, let \(X = \mathbf{Z}\), then examples of relations are \(=, &gt;, \geq, \leq, &lt; ...\), “coprime”, \(\equiv \bmod n\) and so on.
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
A equivalence relation \(\sim\) on \(X\) is one such that
<ol>
	<li>Reflexive: \(a \sim a \ \forall a \in X\).</li>
	<li>Symmetric: \(a \sim b \implies b \sim a \ \forall a, b \in X\).</li>
	<li>Transitive: \(a \sim b, b \sim c \implies a \sim c \ \forall a, b, c \in X\).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Given a set \(X\) with an equivalence relation \(\sim\), we have an equivalence class which is a subset of \(X\) of the form</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
[a] = \{b \in X \ | \ a \sim b\} \quad \text{ for some } a \in X
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Fact: Either \([a] = [b]\) or \([a] \cap [b] = \emptyset\) so \([a] = [b] \implies a \sim b\). 
<br />
<br />
So this equivalence relations gives us a way to partition a given set \(X\) into pairwise disjoint nonempty subsets. In fact we have a bijection between the equivalence relation on \(X\) and the partitions of \(X\). What does this mean? It means that we can go either direction, if we have an equivalence relation, we can get a partition of \(X\) into subsets. And if we have a set of disjoint subsets that partitions \(X\), then we can get an equivalence relation from that. How? any two elements will be in the same equivalence class if they’re in the same subset. So we’re kind of talking about the same thing here. 
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
So now let \((X, \sim)\) be a set with equivalence relation. Define \(Y\) as the set of equivalence classes of \(\sim\). We sometimes denotes \(Y\) with \(X / \sim\) “quotient set of equivalence relation”. Define</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi \ : \ &amp;X \rightarrow \\
     &amp;\pi(a) = [a]
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>\(\pi\) is quotient function. \(\pi\) is surjective. Every equivalence class, has an element \(a\) that is in the set \(X\) by definition. So now given \(\pi\), we can recover the equivalence relation.

The cosets of the trivial subgroups have size 1 so we’re dividing \(H\) isto subsets of size 1 and therefore we get back the earlier Lagrange’s Theorem Example Suppose we have \(\mathbf{Z} \geq \mathbf{Z_3} \geq \mathbf{Z}_{12}\) where \(G = \mathbf{Z}\), \(H = \mathbf{Z}_{3}\) and \(K = \mathbf{Z}_{12}\). We know that \([\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}] = 12\) and \([\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{3}] = 3\) so $$ \begin{align*} [\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}] = [\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{3}] [\mathbf{Z}_{3} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}] \\ 12 = 3[\mathbf{Z}_{3} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}] \end{align*} $$ From this we can deduce that the index of \(\mathbf{Z}_{12}\) inside \(\mathbf{Z}_3\) is 4. Proof of Generalized Lagrange \([H: K]\) is the number of left \(K\)-cosets inside \(H\). So \(aK \subseteq H\). Observe that for any \(aH\), the number of left \(K\)-cosets in \(aH\) is equal to \([H : K]\). Consider the bijection $$ \begin{align*} H &amp;\rightarrow aH \\ h &amp;\rightarrow ah \end{align*} $$ Then \(hk\) under this bijection will be \(ahK\). Example Let \(D_4 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j\}\). Consider: $$ \begin{align*} H &amp;= \langle r^2, j \rangle = \{e, r^2, j, r^2j\} \\ K &amp;= \langle r^2 \rangle = \{e, r^2\} \end{align*} $$ Then the index \([G : H] = \frac{|H|}{|G|} = 2\) which is the number of \(H\)-left cosets in \(G\). Similarly, \([H : K] = 2\) which is the number of \(K-\) left cosets in \(H\). For example $$ \begin{align*} eH &amp;= \{e, r^2, j, r^2j\} \ | \ eK = \{e, r^2\}, \ jK = \{j, r^2j\} \\ rH &amp;= \{r, r^3, rj, r^3j\} \ | \ rK = \{r, r^3\}, \ rjK = \{rj, r^3\}. \end{align*} $$ If you look at \(eH\), observe that it contains both \(K\)-cosets and if you look at \(rH\), you’ll see that it also contains both of the \(K\) cosets. Order Theorem Back to the Order Theorem. For example, for \(|G| = 12\), the order of the elements inside \(G\) are \(o(g) \in \{1,2,3,4,6,12\}\). The question is do we know if there must be a subgroup of order 6? 4? what about 2? For 2, if the order of the group is even, then we must have an element with order 2. To see why, we have the Even Order Theorem as follows: Even Order Theorem If \(|G| = n\) and \(n\) is even, then there exists a \(g \in G\) with \(o(g) = 2\). Proof Observe that if \(a \in G\), then \(a^2 = 2\) if and only if \(a^{-1} = a\). In this case, the order must either be 1 or 2 so \(o(a) \in \{1,2\}\). Now, let \(a \in G\). For each \(a\), produce a subset \(C\) such that \(C = \{a, a^{-1}\}\). This is a subset of \(G\) of order 1 or 2 depending on whether \(a = a^{-1}\). Claim: For \(\{a, a^{-1}\}\) and \(C' = \{b, b^{-1}\}\). Either \(C = C'\) or \(C \cap C' = \emptyset\). Moreover $$ \begin{align*} \bigcup_{a \in G} \{a, a^{-1}\} = G. \end{align*} $$ The union of all these subsets is \(G\). So we get a partition of the set \(G\) into pairwise disjoint subsets of size 1 or 2. So \(n = |G| = r + 2s\). where \(r\) is the number of subsets \(\{a, a^{-1}\}\) of size 1 and \(s\) is the number of subsets \(\{a, a^{-1}\}\) of size \(2\). Notice here that \(r\) is counting all the elements such that each element is its own inverse. So \(r = |\{a \in G \ | \ a^2 = e\}|\). In fact, \(r\) is the number of elements in \(G\) of order 1 or 2. So we showed that \(n = |G| = r + 2s\) but by assumption, \(n\) is even and since it’s even then 2 divides \(n\). So 2 must divide \(r + 2s\). Therefore, \(2\) must divide \(r\). So \(r\) is even. We also know that \(r\) is at least 1 because the identity element has order 1. Therefore, there must exist at least another element whose order is 2. So there exists a \(g \in G\) such that \(o(g) = 2\). \(\ \blacksquare\). There is a generalization of this theorem that we’ll prove later. But if \(p\) is prime and it divides \(|G|\), then there exists an element of order \(p\). Equivalence Relations Review of equivalence relations Definition A relation on a set \(X\) is a subset \(R \subseteq X \times X\). We write \(a \sim b\) for \((a,b) \in R\). For example, let \(X = \mathbf{Z}\), then examples of relations are \(=, &gt;, \geq, \leq, &lt; ...\), “coprime”, \(\equiv \bmod n\) and so on. Definition A equivalence relation \(\sim\) on \(X\) is one such that Reflexive: \(a \sim a \ \forall a \in X\). Symmetric: \(a \sim b \implies b \sim a \ \forall a, b \in X\). Transitive: \(a \sim b, b \sim c \implies a \sim c \ \forall a, b, c \in X\). Given a set \(X\) with an equivalence relation \(\sim\), we have an equivalence class which is a subset of \(X\) of the form $$ \begin{align*} [a] = \{b \in X \ | \ a \sim b\} \quad \text{ for some } a \in X \end{align*} $$ Fact: Either \([a] = [b]\) or \([a] \cap [b] = \emptyset\) so \([a] = [b] \implies a \sim b\). So this equivalence relations gives us a way to partition a given set \(X\) into pairwise disjoint nonempty subsets. In fact we have a bijection between the equivalence relation on \(X\) and the partitions of \(X\). What does this mean? It means that we can go either direction, if we have an equivalence relation, we can get a partition of \(X\) into subsets. And if we have a set of disjoint subsets that partitions \(X\), then we can get an equivalence relation from that. How? any two elements will be in the same equivalence class if they’re in the same subset. So we’re kind of talking about the same thing here. So now let \((X, \sim)\) be a set with equivalence relation. Define \(Y\) as the set of equivalence classes of \(\sim\). We sometimes denotes \(Y\) with \(X / \sim\) “quotient set of equivalence relation”. Define $$ \begin{align*} \pi \ : \ &amp;X \rightarrow \\ &amp;\pi(a) = [a] \end{align*} $$ \(\pi\) is quotient function. \(\pi\) is surjective. Every equivalence class, has an element \(a\) that is in the set \(X\) by definition. So now given \(\pi\), we can recover the equivalence relation.

Definition 2.4.14
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(H\) be subgroup of a group \(G\). <br />
\(gH = \{gh \ | \ h \in H\}\) is called a left coset of \(H\) in \(G\). 
<br />
\(Hg = \{hg \ | \ h \in H\}\) is called a right coset of \(H\) in \(G\).
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>Example 1: Let \(D_4 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j\}\). where \(r^4 = e = j^2\) and \(jr = r^{-1}j\).
<br /> Define the subgroup \(H = \langle j \rangle = \{e, j\}\). The left cosets are:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
eH &amp;= \{e, j\} = jH \\
rH &amp;= \{r, rj\} = rjH \\
r^2H &amp;= \{r^2, r^2j\} = r^2jH \\
r^3H &amp;= \{r^3, r^3j\} = r^3jH \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Notice here that none of the elements overlap between the sets so this gives us a way to partition the set \(G\) into four pairwise disjoint subsets (We’ll prove this next). The right cosets are</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
He &amp;= \{e, j\} = Hj \\
Hr &amp;= \{r, jr\} = \{e, r^3j\} = Hr^3j \\
Hr^2 &amp;= \{r^2, r^2j\} = Hr^2j \\
Hr^3 &amp;= \{r^3, rj\} = Hrj \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Example 2: Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) (with addition) and take \(H = \mathbf{Z}n \leq G\) where \(n \geq 1\). <br />
The left coset is \(a + H = a + \mathbf{Z}n = \{a + kn \ | \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}\) <br />
The left coset is \(H + a = \mathbf{Z}n + a\) which is the same as the right coset. This happens because the group is abelian!<br />
Another name for these cosets are the congruence class \([a]_n\).

<h4><b>Cosets are Pairwise Disjoint</b></h4>
<p>Next we show why these subets must be pairwise disjoint.
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition (2.5.4)
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). If \(X, Y \subseteq G\) are left \(H-\)cosets, then either
<ol>
	<li>\(X \cap Y = \emptyset\).</li>
	<li>\(X = Y\).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We’ll prove that not (1) implies (2) (to prove an or statement). <br />
Suppose that \(g \in X \cap Y\). We want to show that \(X = Y\). Since \(X\) and \(Y\) are left cosets, then we can write \(X = xH\) and \(Y = yH\) for some \(x, y \in G\). Since \(g \in X \cap Y\), then we can write \(g = xh_1 = yh_2\) for some \(h_1, h_2 \in H\). Observe now that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
x &amp;= gh_1^{-1} \\
  &amp;= (yh_2)h_1^{-1} \\
  &amp;= y(h_2h_1^{-1})
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Likewise</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
y &amp;= gh_2^{-1} \\
  &amp;= (xh_1)h_2^{-1} \\
  &amp;= x(h_1h_2^{-1})
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Now, let \(xh \in xH\), then</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
xh &amp;= (yh_2h_1^{-1})h \\
   &amp;= y(h_2h_1^{-1}h)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>But this implies that \(xh \in yH\). So \(xH \subseteq yH\). Likewise, let \(yh \in yH\), then</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
yh &amp;= (xh_1h_2^{-1})h \\
   &amp;= x(h_1h_2^{-1}h)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>so \(yh \in xH\) and \(yH \subseteq xH\). Therefore \(xH = yH\). \(\blacksquare\) 
<br />
<br />
Based on this, we have the following proposition

<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2.5.3
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\), and let \(a\) and \(b\) be
elements of \(G\). The following conditions are equivalent:
<ol type="a">
	<li>\(a \in bH\).</li>
	<li>\(b \in aH\).</li>
	<li>\(aH = bH\).</li>

</ol>
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><br />
<b>Proof (book)</b>
<br />
Suppose \((a)\) holds. Let \(a \in bH\). Then we can write \(a = bh\). Since \(H\) is a subgroup, then we know \(h^{-1} \in H\). So we can write \(b = ah^{-1}\). But \(ah^{-1}\) is in \(aH\) by the definition of a left coset which is what we wanted to show. With similar reason \((b)\) also implies \((a)\). 
<br />
<br />
For \((c)\), we want to show that \(aH \subseteq bH\) and \(bH \subseteq aH\). To show that \(bH \subseteq aH\), we want to show that for any arbitrary element \(x\) in \(bH\), that \(x\) is also in \(aH\). So consider any \(x \in bH\). By the definition of a coset, we can write \(x = bh\) for some \(h \in H\). Now suppose that \((b)\) holds and so we have \(b \in aH\). This means that we can write \(b = ah_1\) for some \(h_1 \in H\). But this means that we can write \(x = bh = ah_1h\). The product \(h_1h\) is in \(H\) because \(H\) is a subgroup. Furthermore, \(ah_1h\) must be in \(aH\) by the definition of a coset. Therefore, \(x = bh \in aH\) and so \(bH \subseteq aH\) as we wanted to show. Since \((b)\) also implies \((a)\) we can use a similar reasoning to show that \(aH \subseteq bH\).

<h4><b>Lagrange Theorem</b></h4>
<p>Based on what we learned so far, we can now present the following important results
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). Then all left \(H-\)cosets and right \(H-\)cosets have the same cardinality as \(H\).
</div>
<p><br />
This works well for infinite groups as well because all we need is a bijection to show they have the same cardinality.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We know the coset \(aH\) is constructed such that each element is appended on the left by \(a\). So naturally construct the following bijection</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
H &amp;\rightarrow aH \\
h &amp;\rightarrow ah
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This works. For any element in \(x \in aH\), the inverse is just \(a^{-1}x\). Likewise we can construct a bijection for the right coset as follows</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
H &amp;\rightarrow Ha \\
h &amp;\rightarrow ha
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br />
This leads to Lagrange Theorem.
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Lagrange Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a finite group and let \(H\) be a subgroup of \(G\). Then \(|H|\) divides \(|G|\) and \(|G| / |H| = \) the number of left cosets of \(H\) in \(G =\) the number of right cosets of \(H\) in \(G\).
</div>
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We know by the previous proposition that all cosets have the same cardinality as \(H\) itself. Moreover, we know that the collection of left cosets \(\{aH, a \in G\}\) partitions \(G\) into pairwise disjoint subsets. Therefore</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|G| &amp;= \sum|aH| \\
    &amp;= \sum |H| \quad \text{(by the previous proposition)}
\end{align*}
$$

<p>From this we see that \(|G| = m|H|\) as we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\)

<br />
This in turn leads to the following theorem:

<h4><b>More Definitions in Cosets</b></h4>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
	The index of a subgroup \(H \leq G\) is the number of left \(H-\)cosets.
	We denote the index by \([G:H]\) which is index of \(H\) in \(G\).
</div>
<p><br />
The index could be infinite but we only care when the index is finite. 
<br />
Using Lagrange’s Theorem also note that if \(G\) is finite, then \([G : H] = \frac{|G|}{|H|}\). 
<br />
Also note that \([G:H]\) can be finite even if \(G\) and \(H\) are infinte.
<br />
<br />
Example: Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}, H = \mathbf{Z_n}\) where \(n &gt; 0\). Then the index of \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) inside \(\mathbf{Z}\) is the number of left cosets which is the number of congruent classes, \([\mathbf{Z}:\mathbf{Z}_n] = n\)
<br />
<br />
We might ask why is the definition is in terms of the number of left cosets and not the right cosets. The answer is in the next proposition
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). There is a bijection between the collection of left cosets and the collection of right cosets.
$$
\begin{align*}
\{aH, a \in G\} \rightarrow \{Ha, a \in G\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br />
The actual bijection is to take all the elements in the left cosets, take their inverses. The collection of inverses will be the elements in the right cosets. Why is this true?
<br />
If \(X = aH = \{aH \ | \ h \in H\}\), then \(X^{-1} = \{ (ah)^{-1} \ | \ h \in H \} = Ha^{-1}\).
<br />
<br />
So why not use \(aH \rightarrow Ha\)? This might not be defined.

Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). The following are equivalent
<ol>
	<li>\(H\) is a normal subgroup.</li>
	<li>Left \(H\)-cosets are the same as right \(H\)-cosets.</li>
	<li>Every left \(H\)-coset is contained in a right \(H\)-coset.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
\((3) \rightarrow (1)\):<br />
Suppose every left \(H\)-coset is a subset of some right \(H\)-coset. Let \(a \in G\). We want to show that \(H\) is a normal subgroup. So we want to show that \(aHa^{-1} \subseteq H\). Given that every left coset in contained in a right coset, consider the left coset \(aH\). This coset is contained in some right coset. Since \(a \in aH\), then \(a\) must be in the right coset as well. We can claim that \(aH \subseteq Ha\). So for any \(h \in H\), \(ah = h'a\) for some \(h' \in H\). Observe that \(aha^{-1} = h'\) for some \(h' \in H\). In other words, \(aHa^{-1} \in H\) and \(H\) is normal. \(\ \blacksquare\)

<p>Let’s look at some applications of the order theorem.
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition

<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(|G| = p\) where \(p\) is prime, then \(G\) is cyclic.
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Let \(g \in G\). By the order theorem, the order of \(g\) must divide \(|G|\) which is a prime number. So \(o(g) \in \{1, p\}\). \(\{e\}\) is the only group with order 1 and \(|G| = p &gt; 1\) so we must have an element \(g \in G\) such that \(g \neq e\). So \(o(g) = p\). But we also said that the order of an element is also the size of the cyclic group generated by \(g\) so \(|\langle g \rangle| = p\). Therefore, we must have \(G = \langle g \rangle\). \(\ \blacksquare\)

If \(|G| = 4\), then \(G\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_4\) or \(V\) the symmetries of the rectangle.
</div>

<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Let \(g \in G\). The order of \(g\) has to divide 4 by the order theorem so \(o(g) \in \{1,2,4\}\). If \(o(g) = 4\), then \(o(g) = 4\) and \(\langle g \rangle = G\) so \(G\) is cyclic and so it is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_4\). If \(o(g) \neq 4\). Then \(G\) must have 4 distinct elements so \(G = \{a, b, c, d\}\)  none of the elements can have order 4. \(a, b, c\) can’t have order 1. So they must be of order 2 and their squares must be the identity. This gives us enough information fill out the multiplication table of this group as follows:</p>

<h4><b>Subgroups of \(D_5\)</b></h4>
<p>Let’s use Lagrange’s Theorem next. Specifically, let’s analyze the subgroups of the dihedral group \(D_5\). First,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
D_5 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4,j\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>The first we want to do when finding its subgroups is find the order of each element in \(D_5\). We know \(|D_5| = 10\) so the orders of the elements must divide 10. We also know that each flip’s order is 2 (because we established previously that \(j^2 = e\)). We also established previously that \(r^5 = e\). The rest of the elements must have their order \(\in \{1,2,5,10\}\) by the Order Theorem. In fact</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Order 1: }&amp;: e. \\
\text{Order 2: }&amp;: j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j. \\
\text{Order 5: }&amp;: r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Now, any subgroup of \(G\) must have order dividing the order of \(G\) so they must divide 10 by Lagrange’s Theorem. So \(|H| \in \{1,2,5,10\}\). Note here that 2 and 5 are prime! so by the previous proposition, they must be cyclic. We list the subgroups as follows by their orders:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Order 1: }&amp;: \{e\}. \\
\text{Order 2: }&amp;: \langle j \rangle , \langle rj \rangle , \langle r^2j\rangle , \langle r^3j\rangle , \langle r^4j\rangle . \\
\text{Order 5: }&amp;: \langle r \rangle. \\
\text{Order 10: }&amp;: D_5. \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We can draw the subgroups as follows</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec13-cosets/d5.png" width="77%" class="center" /></p>

<p>First, let’s find the order of each element knowing that the order of each flip is 2 and know that element must have an order that divides 18. [Side note from studying. Note that \(\langle r \rangle\) is a cyclic subgroup of order 9 and it has the elements \(r, r^2, r^3, ..., r^8\). Each element inside the subgroup must have order \(n / gcd(n,power)\) where n is the order of \(r\). So the order of \(r^3\) is \(9/gcd(9,3) = 3\). Remember that the order of an element depends on the operation of the group and it is the least power \(k\) such that \(g^k = e\).]</p>

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Order 1: }&amp;: e. \\
\text{Order 2: }&amp;: j, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j, r^5j, r^6j, r^7j, r^8j. \\

\text{Order 6: }&amp;: \\
\text{Order 9: }&amp;: r, r^2, r^4, r^5, r^7, r^8. \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>For the subgroups, if the order was 2 or 3, then we know they must be cyclic. In this case, we know all the subgroups of order 2 (all the flips) are cyclic unique subgroups. For orders 3 and 6, they could be cyclic but they could also fail to be cyclic. Take order 3, first we check if there are elements of order 3 in the group. Yes, we have \(r^3\) and \(r^6\). Why we look for those? Because by definition of the order of an element, they will each generate a subgroup of order 3 (Recall from the subgroups lecture \(|\langle g \rangle| = o(g)\)). In fact, here \(r^3\) and \(r^6\) both generate the same subgroup.</p>

<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Order 1: }&amp;: \{e\}. \\
\text{Order 2: }&amp;: \langle j\rangle, \langle rj \rangle, \langle r^2j \rangle, \langle r^3j \rangle, \langle r^4j \rangle, \langle r^5j \rangle, \langle r^6j \rangle, \langle r^7j \rangle, \langle r^8j \rangle. \\
\text{Order 3: }&amp;: \langle r^3 \rangle. \\
\text{Order 6: }&amp;: ? \\
\text{Order 18: }&amp;: D_9. \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>What about order 6? Are there any elements of order 6? No, therefore, there aren’t cyclic groups of order 6. One thing we do know is that any element in that subgroup must have order dividing the order of the subgroup. So any element in it must divide 6 so the choices are \(\{1,2,3,6\}\). Here it’s trial and error. For example guessing \(\langle r^3, j \rangle\), we see that it consists of</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\langle r^3, j \rangle = \{e, r^3, r^6, j, r^3j, r^6j\}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Notice here that \(jr^3 = r^6j\) by the identity \(jr^k = r^{-k}j\). Is there another group of order 6? Instead of \(j\), we can try another element of order 3:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\langle r^3, rj \rangle = \{e, r^3, r^6, rj, r^4j, r^7j\}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Overall, we’ll have the following subgroups. These lines indicate whether the subgroup is contained in another subgroup so \(\{e\}\) is contained in all of them. \(\langle r^3 \rangle\) is contained in \(\langle r^3, j \rangle\).</p>

Examples Example 1: Let \(D_4 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j\}\). where \(r^4 = e = j^2\) and \(jr = r^{-1}j\). Define the subgroup \(H = \langle j \rangle = \{e, j\}\). The left cosets are: $$ \begin{align*} eH &amp;= \{e, j\} = jH \\ rH &amp;= \{r, rj\} = rjH \\ r^2H &amp;= \{r^2, r^2j\} = r^2jH \\ r^3H &amp;= \{r^3, r^3j\} = r^3jH \\ \end{align*} $$ Notice here that none of the elements overlap between the sets so this gives us a way to partition the set \(G\) into four pairwise disjoint subsets (We’ll prove this next). The right cosets are $$ \begin{align*} He &amp;= \{e, j\} = Hj \\ Hr &amp;= \{r, jr\} = \{e, r^3j\} = Hr^3j \\ Hr^2 &amp;= \{r^2, r^2j\} = Hr^2j \\ Hr^3 &amp;= \{r^3, rj\} = Hrj \\ \end{align*} $$ Example 2: Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) (with addition) and take \(H = \mathbf{Z}n \leq G\) where \(n \geq 1\). The left coset is \(a + H = a + \mathbf{Z}n = \{a + kn \ | \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}\) The left coset is \(H + a = \mathbf{Z}n + a\) which is the same as the right coset. This happens because the group is abelian! Another name for these cosets are the congruence class \([a]_n\). Cosets are Pairwise Disjoint Next we show why these subets must be pairwise disjoint. Proposition (2.5.4) Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). If \(X, Y \subseteq G\) are left \(H-\)cosets, then either \(X \cap Y = \emptyset\). \(X = Y\). Proof We’ll prove that not (1) implies (2) (to prove an or statement). Suppose that \(g \in X \cap Y\). We want to show that \(X = Y\). Since \(X\) and \(Y\) are left cosets, then we can write \(X = xH\) and \(Y = yH\) for some \(x, y \in G\). Since \(g \in X \cap Y\), then we can write \(g = xh_1 = yh_2\) for some \(h_1, h_2 \in H\). Observe now that $$ \begin{align*} x &amp;= gh_1^{-1} \\ &amp;= (yh_2)h_1^{-1} \\ &amp;= y(h_2h_1^{-1}) \end{align*} $$ Likewise $$ \begin{align*} y &amp;= gh_2^{-1} \\ &amp;= (xh_1)h_2^{-1} \\ &amp;= x(h_1h_2^{-1}) \end{align*} $$ Now, let \(xh \in xH\), then $$ \begin{align*} xh &amp;= (yh_2h_1^{-1})h \\ &amp;= y(h_2h_1^{-1}h) \end{align*} $$ But this implies that \(xh \in yH\). So \(xH \subseteq yH\). Likewise, let \(yh \in yH\), then $$ \begin{align*} yh &amp;= (xh_1h_2^{-1})h \\ &amp;= x(h_1h_2^{-1}h) \end{align*} $$ so \(yh \in xH\) and \(yH \subseteq xH\). Therefore \(xH = yH\). \(\blacksquare\) Based on this, we have the following proposition Proposition 2.5.3 Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\), and let \(a\) and \(b\) be elements of \(G\). The following conditions are equivalent: \(a \in bH\). \(b \in aH\). \(aH = bH\). \(b^{-1}a \in H\). \(a^{-1}b \in H\). Proof (book) Suppose \((a)\) holds. Let \(a \in bH\). Then we can write \(a = bh\). Since \(H\) is a subgroup, then we know \(h^{-1} \in H\). So we can write \(b = ah^{-1}\). But \(ah^{-1}\) is in \(aH\) by the definition of a left coset which is what we wanted to show. With similar reason \((b)\) also implies \((a)\). For \((c)\), we want to show that \(aH \subseteq bH\) and \(bH \subseteq aH\). To show that \(bH \subseteq aH\), we want to show that for any arbitrary element \(x\) in \(bH\), that \(x\) is also in \(aH\). So consider any \(x \in bH\). By the definition of a coset, we can write \(x = bh\) for some \(h \in H\). Now suppose that \((b)\) holds and so we have \(b \in aH\). This means that we can write \(b = ah_1\) for some \(h_1 \in H\). But this means that we can write \(x = bh = ah_1h\). The product \(h_1h\) is in \(H\) because \(H\) is a subgroup. Furthermore, \(ah_1h\) must be in \(aH\) by the definition of a coset. Therefore, \(x = bh \in aH\) and so \(bH \subseteq aH\) as we wanted to show. Since \((b)\) also implies \((a)\) we can use a similar reasoning to show that \(aH \subseteq bH\). For \((d)\) …. Lagrange Theorem Based on what we learned so far, we can now present the following important results Proposition Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). Then all left \(H-\)cosets and right \(H-\)cosets have the same cardinality as \(H\). This works well for infinite groups as well because all we need is a bijection to show they have the same cardinality. Proof We know the coset \(aH\) is constructed such that each element is appended on the left by \(a\). So naturally construct the following bijection $$ \begin{align*} H &amp;\rightarrow aH \\ h &amp;\rightarrow ah \end{align*} $$ This works. For any element in \(x \in aH\), the inverse is just \(a^{-1}x\). Likewise we can construct a bijection for the right coset as follows $$ \begin{align*} H &amp;\rightarrow Ha \\ h &amp;\rightarrow ha \end{align*} $$ This leads to Lagrange Theorem. Lagrange Theorem Let \(G\) be a finite group and let \(H\) be a subgroup of \(G\). Then \(|H|\) divides \(|G|\) and \(|G| / |H| = \) the number of left cosets of \(H\) in \(G =\) the number of right cosets of \(H\) in \(G\). Proof We know by the previous proposition that all cosets have the same cardinality as \(H\) itself. Moreover, we know that the collection of left cosets \(\{aH, a \in G\}\) partitions \(G\) into pairwise disjoint subsets. Therefore $$ \begin{align*} |G| &amp;= \sum|aH| \\ &amp;= \sum |H| \quad \text{(by the previous proposition)} \end{align*} $$ From this we see that \(|G| = m|H|\) as we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\) This in turn leads to the following theorem: Order Theorem Let \(G\) be a finite group. Then for any \(g \in G\), \(o(g)\) divides \(|G|\). Proof [TODO] More Definitions in Cosets Definition The index of a subgroup \(H \leq G\) is the number of left \(H-\)cosets. We denote the index by \([G:H]\) which is index of \(H\) in \(G\). The index could be infinite but we only care when the index is finite. Using Lagrange’s Theorem also note that if \(G\) is finite, then \([G : H] = \frac{|G|}{|H|}\). Also note that \([G:H]\) can be finite even if \(G\) and \(H\) are infinte. Example: Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}, H = \mathbf{Z_n}\) where \(n &gt; 0\). Then the index of \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) inside \(\mathbf{Z}\) is the number of left cosets which is the number of congruent classes, \([\mathbf{Z}:\mathbf{Z}_n] = n\) We might ask why is the definition is in terms of the number of left cosets and not the right cosets. The answer is in the next proposition Proposition Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). There is a bijection between the collection of left cosets and the collection of right cosets. $$ \begin{align*} \{aH, a \in G\} \rightarrow \{Ha, a \in G\} \end{align*} $$ The actual bijection is to take all the elements in the left cosets, take their inverses. The collection of inverses will be the elements in the right cosets. Why is this true? If \(X = aH = \{aH \ | \ h \in H\}\), then \(X^{-1} = \{ (ah)^{-1} \ | \ h \in H \} = Ha^{-1}\). So why not use \(aH \rightarrow Ha\)? This might not be defined. Proposition Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). The following are equivalent \(H\) is a normal subgroup. Left \(H\)-cosets are the same as right \(H\)-cosets. Every left \(H\)-coset is contained in a right \(H\)-coset. Proof \((3) \rightarrow (1)\): Suppose every left \(H\)-coset is a subset of some right \(H\)-coset. Let \(a \in G\). We want to show that \(H\) is a normal subgroup. So we want to show that \(aHa^{-1} \subseteq H\). Given that every left coset in contained in a right coset, consider the left coset \(aH\). This coset is contained in some right coset. Since \(a \in aH\), then \(a\) must be in the right coset as well. We can claim that \(aH \subseteq Ha\). So for any \(h \in H\), \(ah = h'a\) for some \(h' \in H\). Observe that \(aha^{-1} = h'\) for some \(h' \in H\). In other words, \(aHa^{-1} \in H\) and \(H\) is normal. \(\ \blacksquare\) Applications Let’s look at some applications of the order theorem. Proposition If \(|G| = p\) where \(p\) is prime, then \(G\) is cyclic. Proof Let \(g \in G\). By the order theorem, the order of \(g\) must divide \(|G|\) which is a prime number. So \(o(g) \in \{1, p\}\). \(\{e\}\) is the only group with order 1 and \(|G| = p &gt; 1\) so we must have an element \(g \in G\) such that \(g \neq e\). So \(o(g) = p\). But we also said that the order of an element is also the size of the cyclic group generated by \(g\) so \(|\langle g \rangle| = p\). Therefore, we must have \(G = \langle g \rangle\). \(\ \blacksquare\) Proposition If \(|G| = 4\), then \(G\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_4\) or \(V\) the symmetries of the rectangle. Proof Let \(g \in G\). The order of \(g\) has to divide 4 by the order theorem so \(o(g) \in \{1,2,4\}\). If \(o(g) = 4\), then \(o(g) = 4\) and \(\langle g \rangle = G\) so \(G\) is cyclic and so it is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_4\). If \(o(g) \neq 4\). Then \(G\) must have 4 distinct elements so \(G = \{a, b, c, d\}\) none of the elements can have order 4. \(a, b, c\) can’t have order 1. So they must be of order 2 and their squares must be the identity. This gives us enough information fill out the multiplication table of this group as follows: \(e\) \(a\) \(b\) \(c\) \(e\) \(e\) \(a\) \(b\) \(c\) \(a\) \(a\) \(e\) \(c\) \(b\) \(b\) \(b\) \(c\) \(e\) \(a\) \(c\) \(c\) \(b\) \(a\) \(e\) Subgroups of \(D_5\) Let’s use Lagrange’s Theorem next. Specifically, let’s analyze the subgroups of the dihedral group \(D_5\). First, $$ \begin{align*} D_5 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4,j\} \end{align*} $$ The first we want to do when finding its subgroups is find the order of each element in \(D_5\). We know \(|D_5| = 10\) so the orders of the elements must divide 10. We also know that each flip’s order is 2 (because we established previously that \(j^2 = e\)). We also established previously that \(r^5 = e\). The rest of the elements must have their order \(\in \{1,2,5,10\}\) by the Order Theorem. In fact $$ \begin{align*} \text{Order 1: }&amp;: e. \\ \text{Order 2: }&amp;: j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j. \\ \text{Order 5: }&amp;: r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5. \end{align*} $$ Now, any subgroup of \(G\) must have order dividing the order of \(G\) so they must divide 10 by Lagrange’s Theorem. So \(|H| \in \{1,2,5,10\}\). Note here that 2 and 5 are prime! so by the previous proposition, they must be cyclic. We list the subgroups as follows by their orders: $$ \begin{align*} \text{Order 1: }&amp;: \{e\}. \\ \text{Order 2: }&amp;: \langle j \rangle , \langle rj \rangle , \langle r^2j\rangle , \langle r^3j\rangle , \langle r^4j\rangle . \\ \text{Order 5: }&amp;: \langle r \rangle. \\ \text{Order 10: }&amp;: D_5. \\ \end{align*} $$ We can draw the subgroups as follows Notice that there is 1 group of order 5 while there are 5 groups of order 2. Subgroups of \(D_9\) We list the elements of \(D_9\) as follows $$ \begin{align*} D_9 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5, r^6, r^7, r^8, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j, r^5j, r^6j, r^7j, r^8j\} \end{align*} $$ First, let’s find the order of each element knowing that the order of each flip is 2 and know that element must have an order that divides 18. [Side note from studying. Note that \(\langle r \rangle\) is a cyclic subgroup of order 9 and it has the elements \(r, r^2, r^3, ..., r^8\). Each element inside the subgroup must have order \(n / gcd(n,power)\) where n is the order of \(r\). So the order of \(r^3\) is \(9/gcd(9,3) = 3\). Remember that the order of an element depends on the operation of the group and it is the least power \(k\) such that \(g^k = e\).] $$ \begin{align*} \text{Order 1: }&amp;: e. \\ \text{Order 2: }&amp;: j, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j, r^5j, r^6j, r^7j, r^8j. \\ \text{Order 3: }&amp;: r^3, r^6. \\ \text{Order 6: }&amp;: \\ \text{Order 9: }&amp;: r, r^2, r^4, r^5, r^7, r^8. \\ \end{align*} $$ For the subgroups, if the order was 2 or 3, then we know they must be cyclic. In this case, we know all the subgroups of order 2 (all the flips) are cyclic unique subgroups. For orders 3 and 6, they could be cyclic but they could also fail to be cyclic. Take order 3, first we check if there are elements of order 3 in the group. Yes, we have \(r^3\) and \(r^6\). Why we look for those? Because by definition of the order of an element, they will each generate a subgroup of order 3 (Recall from the subgroups lecture \(|\langle g \rangle| = o(g)\)). In fact, here \(r^3\) and \(r^6\) both generate the same subgroup.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lecture 12: Homomorphism</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/04/math417-12-homomorphism.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lecture 12: Homomorphism" /><published>2025-02-04T00:01:36-08:00</published><updated>2025-02-04T00:01:36-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/04/math417-12-homomorphism</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/04/math417-12-homomorphism.html"><![CDATA[<p>While isomorphisms need to be bijections, Homomorphisms do not.</p>

<div class="mintbodydiv">

<h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p><b>Example 1</b>: Consider the following with the addition operation</p>

	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\pi \ : \ &amp;\mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n\\
	          &amp;a \rightarrow [a]_n
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(\pi\) is a homomorphism because \([a+b] = [a] + [b]\). Remember the rule is that \(\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\) where the first operation comes from the first group while the second operation comes from the second group. Here, both groups have addition as their binary operation. 
<br />
<br />
\(\pi\) is also surjective. Since for any element \(h \in \mathbf{Z}_n\), we have an element \(g \in \mathbf{Z}\) such that \(\pi(g) = [g]\). Moreover, we see that \(ker(\pi) = \mathbf{Z}n = \langle n \rangle\).
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Example 2</b>: Suppose \(g \in G\). Let</p>

<p>We want to show that \(\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\). But we know that \(\varphi(ab) = g^{a+b} =  g^ag^b = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\). So \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism.

<h4><b>Normal Subgroups</b></h4>
<p>It turns out that only a certain kind of subgroups could be kernels of homomorphism.
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
	A normal subgroup of \(G\) is a subgroup \(N \leq G\) such that \(gNg^{-1} = N\) for all \(g \in G\) where \(gNg^{-1} = \{gng^{-1} \ | \ n \in N\}\). 
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
This operation \(x \rightarrow gxg^{-1}\) is called the conjugation of \(x\) by \(g\). The definition says that if we conjeguate all the elements of \(N\) by a fixed element \(g \in G\), then we should get \(N\) back for every \(g\). 
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
To show a subgroup \(N \leq G\) is normal, it suffies to show that \(gNg^{-1} \subseteq N\) for all \(g \in G\).
</div>
<p><br />
That is, we just need to check that each \(gNg^{-1}\) is a subset of \(N\).
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Given that \(gNg^{-1} \subseteq N\). We want to show that this implies that \(N \subseteq gNg^{-1}\) which means that \(gNg^{-1} = N\) which is what is required by the definition.
<br />
<br />
Let \(g \in G\) and \(n \in N\). Observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	n &amp;= (gg^{-1})n(gg^{-1}) \\
	  &amp;= g(g^{-1}ng)g^{-1} \\
	  &amp;= g(x)g^{-1}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>where \(x = g^{-1}ng\). If we show that \(gNg^{-1} \subseteq N\), then we need to show that for any \(n \in N\), this \(n\) can be written as \(n = g^{-1}ng = x\) which means that we want to show that \(x \in N\). But by the hypothesis</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 x &amp;= g^{-1}ng \\
	   &amp;= g^{-1}n(g^{-1})^{-1} \\
	   &amp;= ana^{-1} \quad \text{ (let $a = g^{-1}$ where $g^{-1} \in G$)}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Since \(g^{-1}\) is just an arbitrary element in \(G\), then \(ana^{-1} \in N\) which is what we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>Take \(D_3 = \{e, r, r^2, j, rj, r^2j\}\) where \(r^3 = e = j^2\) and \(jr = r^{-1}j\). This rule also implies \(jr^k = r^{-k}j\). Now suppose we have the subgroup generated by \(j\), \(H = \langle j \rangle = \{e, j\}\). Is this a normal subgroup?
<br />
<br />
For every \(g \in G\), we want to show that \(gHg^{-1} \subseteq H\) so</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 eHe^{-1} &amp;= H. \\
	 rHr^{-1} &amp;= \{rer^{-1}, rjr^{-1}\} = \{e, r^2j\} \neq H.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So we stop here. This is not a normal subgroup. Does \(D_3\) have any normal subgroups? The trivial subgroups are normal subgroups. What about any non-trivial subgroups? It turns out that \(N = \langle r \rangle = \{e,r,r^2\}\) is normal in \(D_3\). We have to check all 6 cases</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 eNe^{-1} &amp;= N \\
	 rNr^{-1} &amp;= N \\
	 r^2Nr^{-2} &amp;= N \\
	 jNr^{-1} &amp;= N \\
	 rjN(rj)^{-1} &amp;= N \\
	 r^2jN(r^2j)^{-1} &amp;= N.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>FACT: If \(G\) has some generating set like \(G = \langle g_1, ..., g_r \rangle\), then to check if \(H\) is normal, we just need to show that \(g_kHg_k^{-1}\) for each \(g_i\) in the generating set \(g_1, ... g_k\). So for \(D_3\), we know it is generated by \(\langle r, j \rangle\), so we can check those two.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Kernels are Normal Subgroups</b></h4>
<p>Back to homomorphisms. It turns out that kernels of homomorphisms are normal subgroups.
<br /></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(\varphi \ : \ G \rightarrow H\) is a homomorphism, then \(K = ker \varphi = \{g \in G \ | \ \varphi(g) = e\} \) is a normal subgroup.
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We know that \(k\) is a subgroup of \(G\). We need to show that given \(g \in G\) and \(x \in K\) that \(gxg^{-1} \in K\). By definition, to check if any element is in the kernel, we need to apply the homomorphism and see if the result is the identity element. So</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \varphi(gNg^{-1}) &amp;= \varphi(g)\varphi(x)\varphi(g)^{-1} \\
					  &amp;= \varphi(g)e\varphi(g)^{-1} \\
					  &amp;= \varphi(g)\varphi(g)^{-1} \\
					  &amp;= e.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>From this, we see \(gKg^{-1} \subseteq K\) for all \(g \in G\). \(\blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
Note also that all subgroups of abelian groups are normal.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Injectivity of Homomorphisms</b></h4>
<p>Another useful fact:
<br /></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(\varphi \ : \ G \rightarrow H\) be a homomorphism, then \(\varphi\) is injective if and only if \(K = ker(\varphi) = \{e\} \).
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
\(\Longrightarrow\): Suppose that \(\varphi\) is injective. This means that if \(\varphi(a) = \varphi(e) = e\), then \(a = e\). But this means that the only element where \(\varphi(a) = e\) is the identity element itself. [why must \(varphi(e)=e\)? I can’t remember, verify].
<br />
<br />
\(\Longleftarrow\):Now suppose that \(K = ker(\varphi) = \{e\}\). We want to show that \(\varphi\) is injective. This means that for any elements \(a, b \in G\), if \(\varphi(a) = \varphi(b)\), then we must have \(a = b\). Let \(\varphi(a) = \varphi(b) = h \in H\). We want to show that \(a = b\). Observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \varphi(a^{-1}b) &amp;= \varphi(a)^{-1}\varphi(b) \\
					  &amp;= h^{-1}h \\
					  &amp;= e_H.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Since \(\varphi(a^{-1}b) = e_H\), then this implies that \(a^{-1}b \in K\). But \(K\) has only a single element which is the identity. Then \(a^{-1}b = e\) which means that \(a = b\) as desired. \(\ \blacksquare\)

Definition 2.4.1 A map between groups \(\varphi : G \rightarrow H\) is called a homomorphism if it preserves group multiplication, \(\varphi(g_1)(g_2) = \varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2)\) for all \(g_1, g_2 \in G\). An endomorphism of \(G\) is a homomorphism \(\varphi: G \rightarrow G\). So Given a homomorphism, if we find that it’s a bijection, then it is an isomorphism. Some Facts about Homomorphisms Proposition 2.4.11 Let \(\varphi : G \rightarrow H\) and \(\psi : G \rightarrow H\) be homomorphisms of groups. \(\varphi(e_G) = e_H\) For each \(g \in G\), \(\varphi(g^{-1}) = (\varphi(g))^{-1}\) Proof (Book) For any \(g \in G\). $$ \begin{align*} \varphi(e_G)\varphi(g) &amp;= \varphi(e_Gg) \quad \text{(because $\varphi$ is a homomorphism)} \\ &amp;= \varphi(g) \end{align*} $$ So \(\varphi(e_G)\) is an identity element in \(H\) but by the uniqueness of the identity element, then \(\varphi(e_G) = e_H\). Similarly, for any \(\in G\), $$ \begin{align*} \varphi(g^{-1})\varphi(g) &amp;= \varphi(g^{-1}g) \quad \text{(because $\varphi$ is a homomorphism)} \\ &amp;= \varphi(e_G) \\ &amp; = e_H \end{align*} $$ And by the uniqueness of the inverse, \(\varphi(g^{-1}) = \varphi(g)^{-1}\). \(\ \blacksquare\) The Image of a Homomorphism Given a homomorphism \(\varphi\) between two groups \(G\) and \(H\), the image of \(\varphi\) which is a subset of \(H\) is also a subgroup. Proposition Given some homomorphism \(\varphi: G \rightarrow H\). The image of this function $$ \begin{align*} \varphi(G) = \{\varphi(g) \ : \ g \in G\} \end{align*} $$ is a subgroup of \(H\). Proof TODO The Kernel of a Homomorphism The kernel of a group is simply all the elements such that \(\varphi(g)=e\). Definition 2.4.14 Let \(\varphi: G \rightarrow H\) be a homomorphism of groups. The kernel of the homomorphism \(\varphi\), denoted \(ker(\varphi)\), is \(\varphi^{-1}(e_H) = \{g \in G \ : \ \varphi(g) = e_H\}\). In fact, The kernel of a group \(K = ker \ \varphi\) is a subgroup of \(G\). Proof We will show this by showing that the kernel satisfies the subgroup properties: We know by Proposition 2.4.11, that \(\varphi(e_G) = e_H\) so \(e_G \in K\). Closed under product: For any \(a,b \in K\), \(\varphi(a)\varphi(b) = e_He_H = e_H \in K\) Closed under inverses: For any \(a \in K\), \(\varphi(a^{-1}) = \varphi(a)^{-1} = e_H^{-1} = e_H\). Therefore,\(a^{-1} \in K\). \(\ \blacksquare\) Examples Example 1: Consider the following with the addition operation $$ \begin{align*} \pi \ : \ &amp;\mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n\\ &amp;a \rightarrow [a]_n \end{align*} $$ \(\pi\) is a homomorphism because \([a+b] = [a] + [b]\). Remember the rule is that \(\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\) where the first operation comes from the first group while the second operation comes from the second group. Here, both groups have addition as their binary operation. \(\pi\) is also surjective. Since for any element \(h \in \mathbf{Z}_n\), we have an element \(g \in \mathbf{Z}\) such that \(\pi(g) = [g]\). Moreover, we see that \(ker(\pi) = \mathbf{Z}n = \langle n \rangle\). Example 2: Suppose \(g \in G\). Let $$ \begin{align*} \varphi \ : \ &amp;\mathbf{Z} \rightarrow G\\ &amp;k \rightarrow g^k \end{align*} $$ We want to show that \(\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\). But we know that \(\varphi(ab) = g^{a+b} = g^ag^b = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\). So \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. Note here that the image of \(\varphi\) is the subgroup generated by \(g\), \(\langle g \rangle\). What about the kernel of \(\varphi\)? $$ \begin{equation*} ker(\varphi) = \begin{cases} \{0\} \quad &amp;\text{if } o(g) = \infty \\ \mathbf{Z}d \quad \quad &amp;\text{if } o(g) = d \end{cases} \end{equation*} $$ Example 3: Consider the following $$ \begin{align*} \varphi \ : \ &amp;D_n \rightarrow S_n\\ &amp;V \rightarrow Sym(V) \end{align*} $$ where \(V\) is the vertices of the polygon. In fact \(\varphi(D_n)\) is isomorphic to \(D_n\) and it is a subgroup of \(S_n\). Example 4: Consider the following $$ \begin{align*} \varphi \ : \ &amp;S_n \rightarrow GL(\mathbf{R}^{x})\\ &amp;\sigma \rightarrow P_{\sigma} \end{align*} $$ where \(P_{\sigma}\) is the matrix associated with the permutation \(\sigma\). For example $$ \begin{align*} (1 \ 2 \ 3) \rightarrow \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \end{align*} $$ Example 5: Consider the following $$ \begin{align*} \psi \ : \ &amp;GL(\mathbf{R}^{x}) \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{x}\\ &amp;P \rightarrow \det(P) \end{align*} $$ This is another homomorphism. In fact, The composition of \(\psi \circ \varphi\) is a homomorphism. That is $$ \begin{align*} \psi \circ \varphi \ : \ &amp;S_n \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{x}\\ &amp;\sigma \rightarrow \det(P_{\sigma}) \end{align*} $$ is a homomorphism. Fact: The composition of two homomorphism is a homomorphism. Example 6: Consider \(V\) where \(V\) is a vector space. Now consider the group \((V, +)\) (throw the scalar multiplication away). This is an abelian group. Consider the linear map $$ \begin{align*} T \ : \ &amp;V \rightarrow W \end{align*} $$ This is a homomorphism (recall that linear maps need to also to preserve scalar multiplication). Furthermore, \(ker T = \{v \in V \ | \ T(v) = 0\}\) (observe that the kernel is also the nullspace of \(T\)). Normal Subgroups It turns out that only a certain kind of subgroups could be kernels of homomorphism. Definition A normal subgroup of \(G\) is a subgroup \(N \leq G\) such that \(gNg^{-1} = N\) for all \(g \in G\) where \(gNg^{-1} = \{gng^{-1} \ | \ n \in N\}\). This operation \(x \rightarrow gxg^{-1}\) is called the conjugation of \(x\) by \(g\). The definition says that if we conjeguate all the elements of \(N\) by a fixed element \(g \in G\), then we should get \(N\) back for every \(g\). Proposition To show a subgroup \(N \leq G\) is normal, it suffies to show that \(gNg^{-1} \subseteq N\) for all \(g \in G\). That is, we just need to check that each \(gNg^{-1}\) is a subset of \(N\). Proof Given that \(gNg^{-1} \subseteq N\). We want to show that this implies that \(N \subseteq gNg^{-1}\) which means that \(gNg^{-1} = N\) which is what is required by the definition. Let \(g \in G\) and \(n \in N\). Observe that $$ \begin{align*} n &amp;= (gg^{-1})n(gg^{-1}) \\ &amp;= g(g^{-1}ng)g^{-1} \\ &amp;= g(x)g^{-1} \end{align*} $$ where \(x = g^{-1}ng\). If we show that \(gNg^{-1} \subseteq N\), then we need to show that for any \(n \in N\), this \(n\) can be written as \(n = g^{-1}ng = x\) which means that we want to show that \(x \in N\). But by the hypothesis $$ \begin{align*} x &amp;= g^{-1}ng \\ &amp;= g^{-1}n(g^{-1})^{-1} \\ &amp;= ana^{-1} \quad \text{ (let $a = g^{-1}$ where $g^{-1} \in G$)} \end{align*} $$ Since \(g^{-1}\) is just an arbitrary element in \(G\), then \(ana^{-1} \in N\) which is what we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\) Examples Take \(D_3 = \{e, r, r^2, j, rj, r^2j\}\) where \(r^3 = e = j^2\) and \(jr = r^{-1}j\).

This is not a normal subgroup. Does \(D_3\) have any normal subgroups? The trivial subgroups are normal subgroups. What about any non-trivial subgroups?

Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
The Dihedral group is the group of rotational symmetries of a regular n-gon in \(\mathbf{R}^3\). It is a subgroup of the special orthogonal matrices, \(SO(3)\).
</div>
<p><br />
Before discussing the Dihedral group, we will discuss the symmetries of the disk. Why? if you inscribe a regular polygon inside a circle, observe that the symmetries of the polygon are a subset of the symmetries of the circle/disk. So it’s helpful to start there.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Symmetries of the Disk</b></h4>
<p>Let \(D \leq SO(3)\) be the rotational symmetries of the unit disk: \(\{(x,y,0) \ | \ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}\). There are two types of rotations in \(D\). A rotation \(g\) around the \(z-\)axis so the \(z-\)axis remains fixed and we’re spinning the disk around it. Here \(g(e_3) = e_3\). The other type is when we flip the disk so the \(z-\)axis is now reversed. Here \(g(e_3) = -e_3\).
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Rotations Around the \(z-\)axis</b></h4>
<p>A rotation around an arbitrary angle which is \(r_{\theta} = Rot_{e_3}(\theta)\). It is always a symmetry around the unit disk. Note here that \(r_0=e\) and if we rotate by more than \(2\pi\), then it’s a rotation we’ve seen before. So \(r_{\theta + 2\pi n} = r_{\theta}\) so we need to specify \(r_{\theta}\) where \(\theta \in [0, 2\pi)]\). Note also that \(r_{\theta}^{-1} = r_{-\theta}\).
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Rotations Around the a Line in the \(xy-\)axis (Flips)</b></h4>
<p>Here the \(z-\)axis will get reversed since we’re flipping the disk by \(180^{\circ}\) (so \(e_3\) will now be \(-e_3\) facing the opposite the direction). The rotation axis itself is parallel to the \(xy\) plane. And we write \(j_{\theta} = Rot_{u_{\theta}}(\pi)\). Just draw a disk and draw any line that goes through the center. This line will be the rotation axis that is fixed and we’re flipping over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec11/disk.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>The rotation vector can written as</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	u_\theta = (\cos \theta)e_1 + (\sin \theta)e_2 + 0e_3
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This vector spans a line \(l_{\theta} = \mathbf{R}u_{\theta}\). This line is in the \(xy\) plane that goes through the vector \(u\). Note here that adding another rotation of \(\pi\) will not change the line so \(j_{\theta + \pi n} = j_{\theta}\). However, the vector \(u_{\theta}\) though will face the other direction after adding \(\pi\) and so \(u_{\theta+\pi} = -u_{\theta}\). Moreover, \(j^2_{\theta} = e\).
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Multiplication of Rotations and Flips</b></h4>

<h4><b>Elements of \(D\)</b></h4>
<p>Based on the previous list, we can now list precisely the elements of (D). We have</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(r_{\theta}\) for unique \(\theta \in [0, 2\pi)\). Noting that \(r_{\theta + 2\pi n} = r_{\theta}\)</li>

<h4><b>Dihedral Groups</b></h4>
<p>Fix \(n \geq 3\). Let \(V = \{u_{\frac{2\pi}{n}k}, k = 0,...,n-1\}\) be the vertices of a regular \(n-\)gon. Note that \(D_n \leq D \leq SO(3)\).

	$$
	\begin{align*}
	r_{\frac{2\pi}{n}} = r = Rot_{\frac{2\pi}{n}}(e_3)

</div>
<p>Rotations in \(D_n\) are therefore: \(e, r, r^2, r^3, ..., r^{n-1}\) where \(r^{k+n} = r^k\).<br />
Flips in \(D_n\) are \(j, rj, r^2,...,r^{n-1}j\) since we established that \(j_{\frac{\pi}{n}k} = r_{\frac{2\pi}{n}}j_0\). In general, we’ll have \(n\) flips for an \(n-\)polygon illustrated as follows</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec11/flips.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Note that \(D_n\) has \(2n\) symmetries total and we have the following identities:</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(r^n = e\)</li>
	<li>\(j^2 = e\)</li>
	<li>\(jr = r^{-1}j\)</li>
	<li>\(j^2 = e\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice also that this group is generated by two elements so \(D_n = \langle r, j\rangle\). Overall, you will see that</p>

It is a subgroup of the special orthogonal matrices, \(SO(3)\). Before discussing the Dihedral group, we will discuss the symmetries of the disk. Why? if you inscribe a regular polygon inside a circle, observe that the symmetries of the polygon are a subset of the symmetries of the circle/disk. So it’s helpful to start there. Symmetries of the Disk Let \(D \leq SO(3)\) be the rotational symmetries of the unit disk: \(\{(x,y,0) \ | \ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}\). There are two types of rotations in \(D\). A rotation \(g\) around the \(z-\)axis so the \(z-\)axis remains fixed and we’re spinning the disk around it. Here \(g(e_3) = e_3\). The other type is when we flip the disk so the \(z-\)axis is now reversed. Here \(g(e_3) = -e_3\). Rotations Around the \(z-\)axis A rotation around an arbitrary angle which is \(r_{\theta} = Rot_{e_3}(\theta)\). It is always a symmetry around the unit disk. Note here that \(r_0=e\) and if we rotate by more than \(2\pi\), then it’s a rotation we’ve seen before. So \(r_{\theta + 2\pi n} = r_{\theta}\) so we need to specify \(r_{\theta}\) where \(\theta \in [0, 2\pi)]\). Note also that \(r_{\theta}^{-1} = r_{-\theta}\). Rotations Around the a Line in the \(xy-\)axis (Flips) Here the \(z-\)axis will get reversed since we’re flipping the disk by \(180^{\circ}\) (so \(e_3\) will now be \(-e_3\) facing the opposite the direction). The rotation axis itself is parallel to the \(xy\) plane. And we write \(j_{\theta} = Rot_{u_{\theta}}(\pi)\). Just draw a disk and draw any line that goes through the center. This line will be the rotation axis that is fixed and we’re flipping over it. The rotation vector can written as $$ \begin{align*} u_\theta = (\cos \theta)e_1 + (\sin \theta)e_2 + 0e_3 \end{align*} $$ This vector spans a line \(l_{\theta} = \mathbf{R}u_{\theta}\). This line is in the \(xy\) plane that goes through the vector \(u\). Note here that adding another rotation of \(\pi\) will not change the line so \(j_{\theta + \pi n} = j_{\theta}\). However, the vector \(u_{\theta}\) though will face the other direction after adding \(\pi\) and so \(u_{\theta+\pi} = -u_{\theta}\). Moreover, \(j^2_{\theta} = e\). Multiplication of Rotations and Flips To describe the group structure, we want to see what happens if we perform two rotations, two flips, a rotation followed by a flip and a flip followed by a rotation. Two Rotations: This case is easy, since two rotations around the \(z-\)axis (spinning around) is just another rotation so $$ \begin{align*} r_{\alpha}r_{\beta} = r_{\alpha+\beta} \end{align*} $$ A Flip by \(\beta\) followed by a Rotation of \(\alpha\) \(r_{\alpha}j_{\beta}\): $$ \begin{align*} r_{\alpha}j_{\beta} = j_{\beta+\frac{\alpha}{2}} \end{align*} $$ But why? We first flip the disk where \(l_{\beta}\) is fixed like before. After the flip, we rotate the disk around the \(z-\)axis by \(\alpha\) as illustrated below So what we want is to compose these two operations into one and find where the fixed rotation axis will be. If you turn the third figure back to the front and now you want to use one flip to get to the same exact positions of the lines in the third figure, you'll see that the new axis will be \(u_{\beta+\frac{\alpha}{2}}\). A Rotation followed by a Flip \(j_{\alpha}r_{\beta}\): $$ \begin{align*} j_{\alpha}r_{\beta} = j_{\alpha-\frac{\beta}{2}} \end{align*} $$ Two Flips \(j_{\alpha}j_{\beta}\). Now this is clearly a rotation since we're back to the same face. but we're flipping by a different axis each time. The final rotation is the difference of the two times two. (TODO: why times 2?) $$ \begin{align*} j_{\alpha}j_{\beta} = r_{2(\alpha-\beta)} \end{align*} $$ Elements of \(D\) Based on the previous list, we can now list precisely the elements of (D).

Definition 2.2.1
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
A non-empty subset \(H\) of a group \(G\) is called a subgroup if \(H\) is itself a group with the group operation inherited from \(G\). We write \(H \leq G\) to indicate that \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\).
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><br />
Example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The group \(SO(3)\), the special orthogonal matrices is a subgroup of \(GL_3(\mathbf{R}\), the group of invertible \(3 \times 3\) matrices. Both of these are under the same operation.</li>
	<li>Non-example: \(\mathbf{Z}_n\): congruence classes modulo \(n\) with addition. We also have \(\phi(n)\): congruence classes with multiplicative inverses. This has the operation multiplication so it's not a subgroup! Even when you define \(\phi(4) = \{[1],[3]\}\) with addition, it will not satisfy the group requirements, so it's not a subgroup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we need to check a lot for subgroups. We have a set of necessary conditions.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
The necessary conditions for a subset \(H\) of \(G\) to be a subgroup of \(G\) are:
<ol>
	<li>\(H\) is not empty</li>
	<li>\(H\) is closed under multiplication. That is, for all elements \(h_1\) and \(h_2\) of \(H\), the products \(h_1h_2\) is also an element of \(H\)</li>
	<li>\(H\) is closed under inverses. For all \(h \in H\), the inverse \(h^{-1}\) is an element of \(H\)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br /></p>
<ul>
	<li>\(H\) is associative. For any \(a,b,c \in H\), \((ab)c = a(bc)\). We're inheriting the same operation from \(G\) so \(H\) must be associative.</li>
	<li>\(H\) has an identity element: We know \(H\) is non-empty by (1). We also know for any \(h \in H\), \(h^{-1} \in H\) by (3). By (2), \(H\) is closed under multiplication so \(hh^{-1} \in H\) but \(hh^{-1} = e\) so the identity element is in \(H\).  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Consider the group \(G = S_4\) (permutations of \(\{1,2,3,4\}\)). The order of this group is \(|G| = 4\). The following are subgroups of \(S_4\):</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(H=\{ \sigma \in S_4 \ | \ \sigma(4) = 4\}\). So this subgroup fixes \(4\) in the permutation. \(|H| = 3! = 6\). In fact, it is permuting only 3 numbers and it is isomorphic to \(S_3\).</li>
	<!---------------------------->
	<li>\(H'=\{e,(1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4), (1 \ 4)(2 \ 3)\}\). It's not empty. It has the identity element. Every element is its own inverse. The one thing not too obvious is proving it is closed. This subgroup is isomorphic to the symmetry group of the rectangle. What's an isomorphism in this case? Assign \(A\) to 1, \(B\) to 2, \(C\) to 3, \(D\) to 4. Recall that the symmetries of the rectangle has the symmetries \(r_1, r_2, r_3, e\) where \(r_1\) is rotating around the \(x-\)axis. Observe now that \(r_1\)
		<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec10/rect-r1.png" width="45%" class="center" /></p>
	</li>
	rotates the vertices such that \(A\) and \(B\) switch positions and \(C\) and \(D\) switch positions. This is equivalent to the permutation \((1 \ 2)(3 \ 4)\). Following this, we'll see that \(r_2\) gets mapped to \((1 \ 4)(2 \ 3)\) and \(r_3\) gets mapped to \((1 \ 3)(2 \ 4)\).
	<!---------------------------->
	<li>\(H''=\{e,(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4)(4 \ 3 \ 2 \ 1), (1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4), (1 \ 4)(2 \ 3), (1 \ 3),(2 \ 4)\}\). This one is isomorphic to \(D_4\) which is the symmetries of the square.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Generated Subgroups</b></h4>
<p>We begin with the following lemma which states that the intersection of a collection of subgroups is another subgroup.
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Lemma (Book Proposition 2.2.8)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(H_1, H_2,...,H_n\) be subgroups of \(G\). Then 
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	H = H_1 \cap H_2 \ \cap ... \cap \ H_n
	\end{align*}
	$$
is a subgroup of \(G\). More generally, if \(\{H_{\alpha}\}\) is any collection of subgroups, then \(\cap_{\alpha}\) is a subgroup.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
</div>
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br /></p>
<ol>
<li>Every \(H_i\) is a subgroup. Therefore \(e \in H_i\) for each \(i\) and thus \(e \in H\).</li>
<li>For any two elements \(a, b \in H\), we must have \(a, b \in H_i\) for each \(i\). Their product \(ab\) must also be in every \(H_i\) since each \(H_i\) is a subgroup. Therefore \(ab \in H\).</li>
<li>For any \(a \in H\), \(a\) must be in \(H_i\) for each \(i\). Therefore \(a^{-1} \in H_i \ \forall i\) and thus \(a^{-1} \in H\).</li>
</ol>
<p>Since any intersection of subgroups is another subgroups, we can then define a generated subgroups as follow
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(S\) be a subset of \(G\). Then
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \langle S \rangle = \bigcap_{\text{All } H_i \leq G \text{ such that } S \subseteq H_i}
	\end{align*}
	$$
\(\langle S \rangle\) is called <b>the subgroup generated by</b> \(S\) and it is the smallest subgroup in \(G\) that contains \(S\).
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><br />
Observe that</p>
<ul>
<li>\(\langle S \rangle\) is a subgroup by the previous lemma since it is the intersection of subgroups.</li>
<li>\(S \subseteq \langle S \rangle\).</li>
<li>It is the smallest group that contains \(S\). Because for any subgroup \(K \leq G\) such that \(S \subseteq K\), we must have \(\langle S \rangle \leq K\) (why? because if \(S\) is contained in \(K\) and \(K\) is a group, then all the products of the elements of \(S\) are in \(K\). Same for the inverses. So the whole subgroup \(\langle S \rangle\) must also be contained in \(K\).)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally from the book:</p>
<ul>
<li>If \(S\) contains a single element, \(S = \{a\}\), then the subgroup generated by \(S\) is denoted by \(\langle a \rangle\). </li>
<li>If \(G = \langle S \rangle\), then \(G\) is generated by \(S\) or \(S\) generates \(G\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way to describe \(\langle S \rangle\) is take a bottom up approach to describe the elements.
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Suppose \(G\) is a group and \(S\) is a subset of \(G\). Then \(\langle S \rangle\) is equal to the set of elements in \(G\) of the form
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 g_1g_2...g_k \quad \text{ where either } g_i \in S \text{ or } g_i^{-1} \in S \text{ for all } i.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><br />
In other words, \(\langle S \rangle\) is a subgroup such that that it contains all the possible products \(g_1g_2...g_n\) which are in \(S\) or an inverse to an element of \(S\). The set that contains such products is often called the “set of words in \(S\)” in group theory.
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Let \(T\) be the set of words \(\{e\} \cup \{g_1...g_k\}\) where \(g_i \in S\) or \(g_i^{-1} \in S\) for all \(i = 1,...,k\). We need to show that</p>
<ol>
	<li>\(T\) is a subgroup of \(G\). [This is true because \(T\) has the identity element. For any two word, the product of these is just a longer word which is also in \(T\). It is closed under the inverses because \((g_1g_2...g_k)^{-1} = g_k^{-1}...g_1^{-1}\).]</li>
	<li>\(S \subseteq T\). [This is true because all the words of length 1 make up the set \(S\). It is true by construction.]</li>
	<li>If \(K \leq G\) is a subgroup such that \(S \subseteq K\), then \(T \subseteq K\). [This is true because if \(K\) contains \(S\) then it must contain all the inverses of these words and then also the products of all of these words since it's a group (closed) so it has all of these elements and it contains \(T\) itself.]</li>
</ol>
<p>Condition (1) and (2) imply that \(\langle S \rangle \subseteq T\). Conditions (1) and (3) imply that \(T \subseteq \langle S \rangle\). Therefore, \(T = \langle S \rangle\). \(\ \blacksquare\) We’ll use this proposition a lot.

<ul>
	<li>\(\langle (1 \ 2) \rangle = \{e, (1 \ 2)\}\). This says that the subgroup generated by \(\{(1 \ 2)\}\) is \(\{e, (1 \ 2)\} = \langle (1 \ 2) \rangle \)</li>
	<li>\(\langle (1 \ 3) \rangle = \{e, (1 \ 3)\}\).</li>
	<li>\(\langle (2 \ 3) \rangle = \{e, (2 \ 3)\}\).</li>
	<li>\(\langle (1 \ 2 \ 3) \rangle = \{e, (1 \ 2 \ 3), (1 \ 3 \ 2)\}\) = \(\langle (1 \ 3 \ 2) \rangle\) </li>
	<li>\(S_3 = \langle (1 \ 2), (1 \ 2 \ 3) \rangle\).</li>

<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition (Book 2.2.9)
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(a\) be an element of a group \(G\). The subgroup \(\langle a \rangle\) generated by \(a\) is \(\{a^k \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}\).

<b>Proof (book)</b>

Let \(H = \{a^k \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}\). We will show that \(\langle a \rangle = H\) as follows:

\(\langle a \rangle \subseteq H\): We know that \(G\) is a group and \(H\) is subset of \(G\). We claim that it is a subgroup of \(G\). It is closed under multiplication because for any \(a^k\) and \(a^l\) in \(H\), \(a^{k+l} \in H\). It is closed under inverses because for any \(a^k \in H\), \((a^{k})^{-1} = a^{-k} \in H\). Furthermore, \(H\) contains \(a\) and since \(H\) is a subgroup, then \(H\) contains all the powers of \(a\). Therefore, \(\langle a \rangle \subseteq H\).

<br />
\(H \subseteq \langle a \rangle\): We showed that \(H = \{a^k \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}\) is a subgroup above. It is closed under multiplication and so it contains all powers of \(a\). Therefore, \(H \subseteq \langle a \rangle\). \(\ \blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Suppose \(G = (\mathbf{Z}, + )\). For any element \(a \in \mathbf{Z}\),</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \langle a \rangle = \{ka \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\} = \mathbf{Z}a.

<ul>
<li>The set of powers of \(a\) is the set of all multiples of \(a\) since the group operation is addition. So \(a+a+a+a+a\) is the fifth power.</li>

<li>If \(a = 0\), then \(\langle a \rangle = \mathbf{Z}0 = \{0\}\)  is the trivial subgroup. </li>

<li>If \(a \neq 0\), then \(\mathbf{Z}a\) is infinite. In fact it is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}\) so \(\mathbf{Z}a \approx \mathbf{Z}\). </li>

<li>Also note, that \(\langle a \rangle  = \langle -a \rangle\).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now consider \(a, b \in \mathbf{Z}\). Suppose we want to find the subgroup generated by the set of \(\{a,b\}\), In other words, \(\langle a,b \rangle\).

<p>This is also a cyclic subgroup because \(\langle a, b \rangle = I(a,b) = \mathbf{Z}d\) where \(d = gcd(a,b)\) So the gcd is the generator of this subgroup. In fact, we will see next that all subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}\) are cyclic

<h4><b>Cyclic Subgroups in \(\mathbf{Z}\)</b></h4>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem

<div class="yellowbodydiv">
<ol>
	<li>All subgroups of \((\mathbf{Z}, +)\) are cyclic except for the trivial subgroup \(\langle 0 \rangle = \{0\}\). </li>
	<li>All subgroups are infinite.</li>
	<li>Each subgroup is generated by  a unique \(d \geq 0\).</li>
	<li>Each non-trivial subgroup is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}\).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof (1)</b>
<br />
To prove that all subgroups are cyclic, we need to find a generator for each of the subgroups. We have two cases:
<br />
If \(H = \{0\}\), then \(H = \mathbf{Z}0\) and we are done.
<br />
If \(H \neq \{0\}\), then \(H\) has at least a non-zero element. By the well ordering principle of \(\mathbf{N}\), there is a smallest element \(d \in H \cap \mathbf{N}\) (\(d\) is the smallest positive element in \(H\)). We claim that \(H = \mathbf{Z}d\). 
<br />
<br />
\(\mathbf{Z}d \subseteq H\): We know \(d \in H\) and \(H\) is a group. Therefore, any multiple of \(d\) is in \(H\) since it must be closed so \(\mathbf{Z}d \subseteq H\) as required.
<br />
<br />
\(H \subseteq \mathbf{Z}d\): Suppose \(x \in H\). We want to show that \(x\) is a multiple of \(d\). Use division with remainder (\(x \div d\)) to get \(x = qd + r\) such that \(q, r \in \mathbf{Z}\) and \(0 \leq r &lt; d\). Observe now that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	r = x - qd.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(x \in H\) by assumption. \(qd \in H\) since \(d \in H\). Therefore, we must have \(r \in H\). But \(d\) is the smallest positive element in \(H\) by the hypothesis and \(r &lt; d\) so \(r\) must be zero. Therefore, \(x = qd \in \mathbf{Z}d\) and \(H = \mathbf{Z}d\) as we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\).

<h4><b>Lattice of subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}\)</b></h4>
<p>We can organize all the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}\) in a lattice ordered by the subset relation. For example the all the multiples of 4 are contained in the multiples of 2, so \(\mathbf{Z}4 \subset \mathbf{Z}4\) and it it goes under \(\mathbf{Z}2\) and so. This lattice is also a divisibility lattice meaning that if \(\mathbf{Z}a \subseteq \mathbf{Z}b\), then \(b \ | \ a\). For example we see that \(\mathbf{Z}6 \subset \mathbf{Z}3\) in the lattice and so this implies that \(3 \ | \ 6\).</p>

<h4><b>Order of an Element</b></h4>
<p>Suppose \(G\) is a group and \(a \in G\), then we denote the order of an element by \(o(a)\). We will define the order of \(a\) is as follows
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
\(o(a) = |\langle a \rangle| \in \mathbf{N} \cap \{\infty\} \)
</div>
<p><br />
This says that the order of an element is equal to the size of its generated subgroup \(\langle a \rangle\). But in an earlier lecture, we also defined the order of an element as follows
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition (Book: 2.2.17)
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
	<ul>
<li>If \(o(a) = n\), then \(n\) is the least positive integer such that \(a^n = e\). Furthermore, \(\langle a \rangle = \{a^k \ : \ 0 \leq k &lt; o(a)\}\).</li>
<li>If \(o(a) = \infty\), then \(a^n \neq e \ \forall n\).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
The claim is that these are equivalent. We will assume the definition and prove that it is equivalent to the order being the smallest positive integer such that \(a^n = e\).
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
By definition, the cyclic subgroup generated by \(a\) is \(\langle a \rangle = \{a^k \ | \ k \in \mathbf{Z} \}\). Suppose that \(o(a) = |\langle a \rangle| = n\). Since \(\langle a \rangle\) is finite, then two powers of \(a\) must coincide. So \(a^i = a^{j}\) for some \(i &lt; j\). This means that \(a^{j-i} = e\) where \(k = j - i &gt; 0\) (side note: why? think of the integers mod 7 with addition, \(2^2 = 2+2\) and \(2^9=18\) both leave a remainder of 4. While \(2^7\) is \(e\)). By the well-ordering principle, there a least \(k\) such that \(a^k = e\), We want to show that \(k\) is equal to the order of \(\langle a \rangle\) which is \(n\). 
<br />
<br />
Now, suppose we have some power \(m\) of \(a\). Write \(m = kq + r\) where \(0 \leq r &lt; k\) and \(r = rem_k(m)\). So \(a^m = (a^k)^qa^r = a^qa^r = a^r\). This means that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \langle a \rangle = \{e, a, a^2, ..., a^{k-1}\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Since \(n\) is the size of the set by assumption, then \(n \leq k\). But that means that that we have two powers in the set above that must coincide where \(a\) raised to the power of their difference is the identity element. But this is a contradiction since we said that \(k\) is the smallest positive number such that \(a^k = e\). Therefore, we must have \(n = k\). So the minimality of \(k\) implies their equality. 
<br />
<br />
If \(\langle a \rangle\) is infinite, we can use the same argument to show that if \(a^k = e\) for some \(k &gt; 0\), then all elements can be written as \(\langle a \rangle = \{e, a, a^2, ..., a^{k-1}\}\) but this is a finite set which is a contradiction. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
The notion of order leads to the following result
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition (Book 2.2.20)

<div class="peachbodydiv">

</ol>
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof (book)</b>
<br />
For \((a)\), we want to show this by finding an example of an isomorphism. So define the map</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \varphi \ : \ &amp;\mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \langle a \rangle \\
	 &amp;\varphi(k) = a^k.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To show that this map is an isomorphism, we need to show that it is a bijection and also that for any two elements \(a, b \in \mathbf{Z}\), \(\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\) (Definition 2.1.13).
<br />
<br />
To show that it is a bijection, observe that this map is surjective or onto by the definition of \(\langle a \rangle\). (Recall that that \(\langle a \rangle\) is of infinite order). It is also injective or 1-1 because all the elements of \(\langle a \rangle\) (powers of \(a\)) are distinct. Furthermore, observe that for any \(k, l \in \mathbf{Z}\)</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \varphi(k + l) &amp;= a^{k + l}, \\
	 \varphi(k)\varphi(l) &amp;= a^k a^l = a^{k+1}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So \(\varphi\) is an isomorphism.
<br />
<br />
Similarly for \((b)\), we want to define an isomorphism. Note here that both \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) and \(\langle a \rangle\) have \(n\) elements so define the map</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \varphi \ : \ &amp;\mathbf{Z}_n \rightarrow \langle a \rangle \\ 
	 &amp;\varphi([k]) = a^k.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>where \(0 \leq k \leq n-1\). In \(\mathbf{Z}_n\), This map is both injective and surjective. Furthermore, observe that \([k] + [l] = [k+l]\) but since we’re module class \(n\), then \([k+l] = [qn + r] = [0 + r] = [r]\) so</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \varphi([k] + [l]) &amp;= a^{[k + l]} = a^{[r]}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>while,</p>

	\begin{align*}
	 \varphi([k])\varphi([l]) &amp;= a^{[k]}a^{[l]} = a^{[k+l]} = a^{[r]}.

<p>Therefore \(\varphi\) is an isomorphism.

<br />
<br />
To prove this theorem we need the following lemma:
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Lemma
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Given a subset \(H \subseteq \mathbf{Z}_n\). Define
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\tilde{H} &amp;= \{a \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ [a]_n \in H \} \subseteq \mathbf{Z} \\
	          &amp;= \bigcup_{S \in H} S

	$$
Then, \(H\) is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) if and only if \(\tilde{H}\) is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}\).
</div>
<p><br />
So \(H\) is a set of integers such that the elements are the representatives of the congruence classes in \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). The proof of this lemma is in the lecture notes.
<br />
<br />
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Theorem Proof</b>
<br />
For (1), Let \(H \leq \mathbf{Z}_n\) be a subgroup. We want to show that \(H\) is cyclic by proving that \(H\) is a cyclic group generated by some element. Consider \(\tilde{H}\). Since \(H\) is a subgroup, then \(\tilde{H}\) is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) by the lemma. Moreover, \(\tilde{H} = \mathbf{Z}d\) for some \(d \in \mathbf{Z}\) by the previous theorem (every subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}\) is cyclic and is generated by some \(d\)). Therefore, by the definition of \(\tilde{H}\), \([d]\) must be a congruence class in \(H\). This implies that \(\langle [d] \rangle \subseteq H\) since \(H\) is a group and all multiples of \(d\) must be in \(H\). 
<br />
<br />
To prove the other direction \(H \subseteq \langle [d] \rangle\), consider \([a] \in H\). This means that \(a \in \tilde{H}\) by the definition of \(\tilde{H}\). But \(\tilde{H} = \mathbf{Z}d\) so \(a\) is a multiple of \(d\) and we can write \(a = sd\) for some \(s \in \mathbf{Z}\). Therefore, \([a] = s[d]\) and \([a] \in \langle [d] \rangle\). Therefore, \(H = \langle d \rangle\) and \(H\) is cyclic as we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
For (2), suppose that \(d = gcd(a,n)\). We want to show that \(\langle [a] \rangle = \langle [d] \rangle\). Since \(d\) is the gcd, then \(d\) divides both \(a\) and \(n\). Also \(d = I(a,n)\) and we can write \(d = sa + tn\) for some \(s, t \in \mathbf{Z}\). 
<br />
<br />
Since \(a \ | \ d\), then \(a = sd\) and so \([a] = s[d]\) so \(\langle [a] \rangle \subseteq \langle [d] \rangle\). Since \(d = sa + tn\), then \([d] = s[d] + t[n] = s[d]\) because \([n] = [0]\) since we’re in \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). Therefore, \(\langle [d] \rangle \subseteq \langle [a] \rangle\). So we’ve shown that \(\langle [a] \rangle = \langle [d] \rangle\) as we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\)

We write \(H \leq G\) to indicate that \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\). Example: The group \(SO(3)\), the special orthogonal matrices is a subgroup of \(GL_3(\mathbf{R}\), the group of invertible \(3 \times 3\) matrices. Both of these are under the same operation. Non-example: \(\mathbf{Z}_n\): congruence classes modulo \(n\) with addition. We also have \(\phi(n)\): congruence classes with multiplicative inverses. This has the operation multiplication so it's not a subgroup! Even when you define \(\phi(4) = \{[1],[3]\}\) with addition, it will not satisfy the group requirements, so it's not a subgroup. Since we need to check a lot for subgroups. We have a set of necessary conditions. Proposition The necessary conditions for a subset \(H\) of \(G\) to be a subgroup of \(G\) are: \(H\) is not empty \(H\) is closed under multiplication. That is, for all elements \(h_1\) and \(h_2\) of \(H\), the products \(h_1h_2\) is also an element of \(H\) \(H\) is closed under inverses. For all \(h \in H\), the inverse \(h^{-1}\) is an element of \(H\) Proof \(H\) is associative. For any \(a,b,c \in H\), \((ab)c = a(bc)\). We're inheriting the same operation from \(G\) so \(H\) must be associative. \(H\) has an identity element: We know \(H\) is non-empty by (1). We also know for any \(h \in H\), \(h^{-1} \in H\) by (3). By (2), \(H\) is closed under multiplication so \(hh^{-1} \in H\) but \(hh^{-1} = e\) so the identity element is in \(H\). Example Consider the group \(G = S_4\) (permutations of \(\{1,2,3,4\}\)). The order of this group is \(|G| = 4\). The following are subgroups of \(S_4\): \(H=\{ \sigma \in S_4 \ | \ \sigma(4) = 4\}\). So this subgroup fixes \(4\) in the permutation. \(|H| = 3! = 6\). In fact, it is permuting only 3 numbers and it is isomorphic to \(S_3\). \(H'=\{e,(1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4), (1 \ 4)(2 \ 3)\}\). It's not empty. It has the identity element. Every element is its own inverse. The one thing not too obvious is proving it is closed. This subgroup is isomorphic to the symmetry group of the rectangle. What's an isomorphism in this case? Assign \(A\) to 1, \(B\) to 2, \(C\) to 3, \(D\) to 4. Recall that the symmetries of the rectangle has the symmetries \(r_1, r_2, r_3, e\) where \(r_1\) is rotating around the \(x-\)axis. Observe now that \(r_1\) rotates the vertices such that \(A\) and \(B\) switch positions and \(C\) and \(D\) switch positions. This is equivalent to the permutation \((1 \ 2)(3 \ 4)\). Following this, we'll see that \(r_2\) gets mapped to \((1 \ 4)(2 \ 3)\) and \(r_3\) gets mapped to \((1 \ 3)(2 \ 4)\). \(H''=\{e,(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4)(4 \ 3 \ 2 \ 1), (1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4), (1 \ 4)(2 \ 3), (1 \ 3),(2 \ 4)\}\). This one is isomorphic to \(D_4\) which is the symmetries of the square. Generated Subgroups We begin with the following lemma which states that the intersection of a collection of subgroups is another subgroup. Lemma (Book Proposition 2.2.8) Let \(G\) be a group and let \(H_1, H_2,...,H_n\) be subgroups of \(G\). Then $$ \begin{align*} H = H_1 \cap H_2 \ \cap ... \cap \ H_n \end{align*} $$ is a subgroup of \(G\). More generally, if \(\{H_{\alpha}\}\) is any collection of subgroups, then \(\cap_{\alpha}\) is a subgroup. Proof Every \(H_i\) is a subgroup. Therefore \(e \in H_i\) for each \(i\) and thus \(e \in H\). For any two elements \(a, b \in H\), we must have \(a, b \in H_i\) for each \(i\). Their product \(ab\) must also be in every \(H_i\) since each \(H_i\) is a subgroup. Therefore \(ab \in H\). For any \(a \in H\), \(a\) must be in \(H_i\) for each \(i\). Therefore \(a^{-1} \in H_i \ \forall i\) and thus \(a^{-1} \in H\). Since any intersection of subgroups is another subgroups, we can then define a generated subgroups as follow Definition Let \(G\) be a group and let \(S\) be a subset of \(G\). Then $$ \begin{align*} \langle S \rangle = \bigcap_{\text{All } H_i \leq G \text{ such that } S \subseteq H_i} \end{align*} $$ \(\langle S \rangle\) is called the subgroup generated by \(S\) and it is the smallest subgroup in \(G\) that contains \(S\). Observe that \(\langle S \rangle\) is a subgroup by the previous lemma since it is the intersection of subgroups. \(S \subseteq \langle S \rangle\). It is the smallest group that contains \(S\). Because for any subgroup \(K \leq G\) such that \(S \subseteq K\), we must have \(\langle S \rangle \leq K\) (why? because if \(S\) is contained in \(K\) and \(K\) is a group, then all the products of the elements of \(S\) are in \(K\). Same for the inverses. So the whole subgroup \(\langle S \rangle\) must also be contained in \(K\).) Additionally from the book: If \(S\) contains a single element, \(S = \{a\}\), then the subgroup generated by \(S\) is denoted by \(\langle a \rangle\). If \(G = \langle S \rangle\), then \(G\) is generated by \(S\) or \(S\) generates \(G\) Another way to describe \(\langle S \rangle\) is take a bottom up approach to describe the elements. Proposition Suppose \(G\) is a group and \(S\) is a subset of \(G\). Then \(\langle S \rangle\) is equal to the set of elements in \(G\) of the form $$ \begin{align*} g_1g_2...g_k \quad \text{ where either } g_i \in S \text{ or } g_i^{-1} \in S \text{ for all } i. \end{align*} $$ In other words, \(\langle S \rangle\) is a subgroup such that that it contains all the possible products \(g_1g_2...g_n\) which are in \(S\) or an inverse to an element of \(S\). The set that contains such products is often called the “set of words in \(S\)” in group theory. Proof Let \(T\) be the set of words \(\{e\} \cup \{g_1...g_k\}\) where \(g_i \in S\) or \(g_i^{-1} \in S\) for all \(i = 1,...,k\). We need to show that \(T\) is a subgroup of \(G\). [This is true because \(T\) has the identity element. For any two word, the product of these is just a longer word which is also in \(T\). It is closed under the inverses because \((g_1g_2...g_k)^{-1} = g_k^{-1}...g_1^{-1}\).] \(S \subseteq T\). [This is true because all the words of length 1 make up the set \(S\). It is true by construction.] If \(K \leq G\) is a subgroup such that \(S \subseteq K\), then \(T \subseteq K\). [This is true because if \(K\) contains \(S\) then it must contain all the inverses of these words and then also the products of all of these words since it's a group (closed) so it has all of these elements and it contains \(T\) itself.] Condition (1) and (2) imply that \(\langle S \rangle \subseteq T\). Conditions (1) and (3) imply that \(T \subseteq \langle S \rangle\). Therefore, \(T = \langle S \rangle\). \(\ \blacksquare\) We’ll use this proposition a lot. Lattice of Subgroups Consider the group \(S_3 = \{e, (1 \ 2), (1 \ 3), (2 \ 3), (1 \ 2 \ 3), (1 \ 3 \ 2)\}\). We can list its subgroups in terms of its generating subsets as follows: \(\langle (1 \ 2) \rangle = \{e, (1 \ 2)\}\). This says that the subgroup generated by \(\{(1 \ 2)\}\) is \(\{e, (1 \ 2)\} = \langle (1 \ 2) \rangle \) \(\langle (1 \ 3) \rangle = \{e, (1 \ 3)\}\). \(\langle (2 \ 3) \rangle = \{e, (2 \ 3)\}\). \(\langle (1 \ 2 \ 3) \rangle = \{e, (1 \ 2 \ 3), (1 \ 3 \ 2)\}\) = \(\langle (1 \ 3 \ 2) \rangle\) \(S_3 = \langle (1 \ 2), (1 \ 2 \ 3) \rangle\). We can then draw this in the following figure]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Groups and Isomorphism</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/01/math417-08-groups-and-isomorphism.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Groups and Isomorphism" /><published>2025-02-01T00:01:36-08:00</published><updated>2025-02-01T00:01:36-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/01/math417-08-groups-and-isomorphism</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/01/math417-08-groups-and-isomorphism.html"><![CDATA[<div class="mintheaderdiv">

<h4><b>Basic Properties of Groups</b></h4>
<p>In the next few propositions, we’ll prove that the identity element in a group is unique and similarly the inverses are unique.
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
The identity element is unique.
</div>
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Let \(e\) and \(e'\) be identity elements. Then by definition for any \(x, y \in G\)</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 xe &amp;= x = ex \\
	 ye' &amp;= y = e'y
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>If we let \(x = e'\) and let \(y = e\), then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 e'e &amp;= e' = ee' \\
	 ee' &amp;= e = e'e
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>From this we see that \(e = e'\) as desired. \(\ \blacksquare\)

<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Inverses in a group are unique.
</div>
<p><br />
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Let \(a \in G\) and suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(a\) has two inverses \(b\) and \(c\). That is \(ab = e = ba\) and \(ac = e = ca\). Then,</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 c = ec = (ba)c = b(ac) = be = b.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Therefore, \(c = b\) which is a contradiction so the inverse must be unique. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition (2.1.2)
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(a, b \in G\). If \(ab = e\), then \(a = b^{-1}\). Likewise, if \(ba = e\), then \(b = a^{-1}\).
</div>
<p><br />
By definition, \(b\) an inverse of \(a\) if \(ab = ba = e\) so it’s an inverse on both sides. This proposition proposes that checking only one side is enough. That is if \(ab = e\), then \(a = b^{-1}\) and \(b\) is the inverse. So what we want to show here is that given \(ba = e\), then \(b\) is the inverse of \(a\). We don’t check the other side. One side is enough to imply the other.
<br />
<br />
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We know from the previous proposition that \(a\) has an inverse \(a^{-1} \in G\). Now consider the expression \(a^{-1}ab\). By associativity, we can reduce this expression in two ways</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (a^{-1}a)b &amp;= a^{-1}(ab)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The left hand side</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (a^{-1}a)b &amp;= eb = b
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The right hand side is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 a^{-1}(ab) &amp;= a^{-1}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So \(b = a^{-1}\) and therefore, \(ba = a^{-1}a = e\). 
<br />
<br />
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof (Book)</b>
<br />
Suppose \(hg = e\), then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 h = h(gg^{-1}) = (hg)g^{-1}= eg^{-1} = g^{-1}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Suppose now that \(gh = e\), then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 g = g(hh^{-1}) = (gh)h^{-1} = eh^{-1} = h^{-1}. \ \blacksquare

Corollary 2.1.3

Let \(g\) be an element of a group \(G\). We have \(g = (g^{-1})^{-1}\)

We know \(gg^{-1} = e\). By (2.1.2) \(g = (g^{-1})^{-1}\). \(\ \blacksquare\)

<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2.1.4

<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(a,b \in G\). Then We have \((ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}\)

<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Notice that \((ab)(b^{-1}a^{-1}) = a(b((b^{-1}a^{-1})) = a((bb^{-1})a^{-1}) = a(ea^{-1}) = aa^{-1} = e\). Therefore, \((ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}\).

<h4><b>The Left and Right Multiplication Maps</b></h4>

<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2.1.5
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and \(a \in G\). <br />
The map \(L_a: G \rightarrow G\) defined by \(L_a(x) = ax\) is a bijection. Similarly, <br />
the map \(R_a: G \rightarrow G\) defined by \(R_a(x) = xa\) is a bijection.
</div>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
To show that the map \(L_a\) is a bijection, we need to show that \(L_a\) is both one to one and onto or equivalently that \(L_a\) has an inverse. We claim that the left multiplication by \(a^{-1}\) or \(L_{a^{-1}}\) is the inverse of \(L_a\). To see that,</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	L_{a^{-1}}(L_a(x)) = a^{-1}(ax) = (a^{-1}a)x = ex = x.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Similarly,</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	L_a(L_{a^{-1}}(x)) = a(a^{-1}x) = (aa^{-1})x = ex = x.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So \(L_{a^{-1}}\) and \(L_a\) are inverse maps so both are bijective. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br /></p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Corollary 2.1.6
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(a\) and \(b\) be elements of \(G\). The equation \(ax = b\) has a unique solution \(x\) in \(G\). and likewise the equation \(xa = b\) has a unique solution in \(G\).
</div>
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
For \(ax = b\) to have a solution. The map \(L_a\) needs to be onto or surjective. For the solution to be unique, the map needs to be one to one or injective. Similarly for \(xa = b\) to have a solution, we want \(R_a\) to be a bijective. Since we proved earlier that \(L_a\) and \(R_a\) are bijections, then both equations have unique solutions. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br /></p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Corollary 2.1.7 (Cancellation)
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Suppose \(a, x, y\) are elements of a group \(G\). If \(ax = ay\), then \(x = y\). Similarly, if \(xa = ya\), then \(x = y\).
</div>
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Suppose \(ax = ay\). We know that \(L_a(x) = ax\) is one to one. So for any elements \(x, y \in G\), \(ax = ay\) must imply that \(x = y\) by definition of a one to one or injective map. A similar arguments shows that if \(xa = ya\) must imply that \(x = y\) by the injectivity of \(R_a\). \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br /></p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Corollary 2.1.8
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(G\) is a finite group, each row and each column of the multiplication table of \(G\) contains each element of \(G\) exactly once.
</div>
<p><br />
<b>Proof (book)</b>
<br />
A row in the multiplication table can be represented by a left multiplication map \(G \rightarrow G\) if you fix the element multiplied on the left. We know the left multiplication map is a bijection. Therefore every element/result must be unique and each element of \(G\) must show up in the row. Similarly, each column can be represented by a right multiplication map. The map is a bijection and so each element must be unique and shown exactly once. (TODO clean up this proof)
<br />

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Associativity in Groups</b></h4>
<p>We know by definition that the product is associative so for all \(a, b, c \in G\), we have \((ab)c = a(bc)\). What about the product of 4 or more elements? is it associative? For example, there are five ways to group four elements</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	a(b(cd)), a((bc)d), (ab)(cd), (a(bc))d, ((ab)c)d
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(a(b(cd))\) and \(((ab)c)d\) follow from the definition. For the rest, see that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	a(bcd) = a(b(cd)) = (ab)(cd) = ((ab)c)d = (abc)d
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>How many ways are there to associate an \(n\)-fold product?</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\frac{1}{2}\binom{2n - 2}{n - 1}
	\end{align*}
	$$

<p>In general this works for any number of elements. Formally,

<h4><b>Isomorphism</b></h4>
<p>One thing that we want to do is to compare two groups. For example take \((\mathbf{Z}_4, +)\), the symmetries of the rectangle, \((\phi(5), \cdot)\) and \((\phi(8), \cdot)\). These are all groups with exactly 4 elements. To compare two groups, we want to see if we can construct a bijection between the two groups. Formally, this is called an isomorphism as follows
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition 2.1.13
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
We say two groups \(G\) and \(H\) are isomorphic if there is a bijection \(\varphi: G \rightarrow H\) such that for all \(a, b \in G\)
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)	
	\end{align*}
	$$
where the first multiplication is in \(G\) while the second is in \(H\).<br />
 The map \(\varphi\) is called an isomorphism.
</div>
<p><br />
<br />
We write \(H \approx G\) for \(G\) is isomorphic to \(H\).
<br />
<br />
An an example consider the group of symmetries of the equilateral triangle \(D_3\) and the group \(S_3\) (permutations of \(\{1,2,3\}\)). Both groups contain exactly 6 elements. They turn out to be isomorphic. Observe here that if we assign the vertices \(A\) to \(1\), \(B\) to \(2\) and \(C\) to \(3\), then the rotation \(a\) flips the vertices \(B\) and \(C\). This is exactly the same as the permutation \((2 \ 3)\). Similarly, if you think about the rotation \(r\), you’ll notice that \(r\) permutes the vertices in the exact way as the permutation \((1 \ 2 \ 3)\). In fact, all permutations. Another example is the \(b\) rotation. This rotation fixes \(b\) and rotates \(a\) and \(c\). This is also the same as the permutation \((1 \ 3)\). We can map the rest of the symmetries as follows</p>

<h4><b>Groups of Small Order</b></h4>

The order of a group is its size or cardinality. We will denote the order of a group \(G\) by \(|G|\).

	<li>Order 2: Up to isomorphism, the only unique group is \(\mathbf{Z}_2 = \{[0], [1], [2]\}\).</li>
	<li>Order 3: Up to isomorphism, the only unique group is \(\mathbf{Z}_3\). All other groups of size 3 will be isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_3\).</li>

	<li>Order 5: Up to isomorphism, the only unique group is \(\mathbf{Z}_5\)</li>
	<li>Order 6: Up to isomorphism, we have two unique groups. \(\mathbf{Z}_6\) and \(S_3 \approx D_3\). These two groups are not isomorphic because \(S_3\) is non-abelian while \(\mathbf{Z}_6\) is abelian. The proof for this fact is next.</li>

Suppose that \(\phi: G \rightarrow H\) is an isomorphism. Furthermore, let \(a, b \in G\) and \(a', b' \in H\) such that \(\phi^{-1}(a') = a\) and \(\phi^{-1}(b') = b'\). We will prove both directions of the statement.
<br />
<br />
\(\Rightarrow\): Suppose that \(G\) is abelian. We will show that \(H\) is abelian. Observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(ab) &amp;= \phi(a)\phi(b) = a'b' \\
	\phi(ba) &amp;= \phi(b)\phi(a) = b'a'.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>But we know that \(G\) is abelian and so \(ab = ba\) so \(\phi(ab) = \phi(ba)\) and therefore we must have \(a'b' = b'a'\).
<br />
<br />
\(\Leftarrow\): Now suppose that \(H\) is abelian. Then,</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(ab) &amp;= \phi(a)\phi(b) = a'b' \\
	\phi(ba) &amp;= \phi(b)\phi(a) = b'a'.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We know that \(a'b' = b'a'\) because \(H\) is abelian. But since \(\phi\) is injective, this implies that \(ab = ba\). (remember injective means that \(f(a)=f(b) \implies a = b\)). \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
Note that for this direction, we could’ve instead relied on \(\phi^{-1}\) being an isomorphism itself. and so observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi^{-1}(a'b') &amp;= \phi^{-}(a')\phi^{-}(b') = ab \\
	\phi^{-1}(b'a') &amp;= \phi^{-}(b')\phi^{-}(a') = ba.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(H\) is abelian so \(a'b' = b'a'\) so \(\phi^{-1}(a'b') = \phi^{-1}(b'a')\) and thus \(ab = ba\).

Extra Notes from the book: Two groups are isomorphic means that the multiplication tables match up. In fact, not only that but the identity elements and inverses of elements match up as well. The following propositions state these facts.

<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2.1.18
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(\phi : G \rightarrow H\) is an isomorphism, then \(\phi(e_G) = e_H\), and for each \(g \in G\), \(\phi(g^{-1}) = \phi(g)^{-1}\)
</div>
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Since \(\phi\) is an isomorphism, then we know that for each \(h \in H\), there is a \(g \in G\) such that \(\phi(g) = h\). Therefore,</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(e_G)h &amp;= \phi(e_G)\phi(g) \\
	           &amp;= \phi(e_Gg) \quad \text{$\phi$ is an isomorphism}\\
			   &amp;= \phi(g) \\
			   &amp;= h \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So \(\phi(e_G)\) is an identity element. But since the identity element is unique, then \(\phi(e_G) = \phi(e_H)\).
<br />
<br />
To show that \(\phi(g^{-1}) = \phi(g)^{-1}\), see that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(g^{-1})\phi(g) &amp;= \phi(g^{-1}g) \quad \text{$\phi$ is an isomorphism} \\
	        &amp;= \phi(e_G) \\
			&amp;= e_H \quad \text{by the previous result} 	
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So \(\phi(g)\) is the inverse of \(\phi(g^{-1})\) or in other words \(\phi(g)^{-1} = \phi(g^{-1})\) as we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\)

The operation is associative so that \((ab)c = a(bc), \forall a,b,c \in G\) There exists an identity element. \(\exists e \in G\) such that \(ae = a = ea \forall a \in G\). Every element has an inverse. \(\forall a \in G, \exists a^{-1} \in G\) such that \(aa^{-1} = e = a^{-1}a\). Additionally, a group is commutative/abelian if \(ab = ba, \forall a, b \in G.\). In addition to groups, we also have Monoids which satisfy \((1)\) and \((2)\). Semi-groups which satisfy \((1)\). Magma \(G, \cdot\) with no additional properties. Basic Properties of Groups In the next few propositions, we’ll prove that the identity element in a group is unique and similarly the inverses are unique. Proposition The identity element is unique. Proof Let \(e\) and \(e'\) be identity elements. Then by definition for any \(x, y \in G\) $$ \begin{align*} xe &amp;= x = ex \\ ye' &amp;= y = e'y \end{align*} $$ If we let \(x = e'\) and let \(y = e\), then $$ \begin{align*} e'e &amp;= e' = ee' \\ ee' &amp;= e = e'e \end{align*} $$ From this we see that \(e = e'\) as desired. \(\ \blacksquare\) Proposition Inverses in a group are unique. Proof Let \(a \in G\) and suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(a\) has two inverses \(b\) and \(c\). That is \(ab = e = ba\) and \(ac = e = ca\). Then, $$ \begin{align*} c = ec = (ba)c = b(ac) = be = b. \end{align*} $$ Therefore, \(c = b\) which is a contradiction so the inverse must be unique. \(\ \blacksquare\) Proposition (2.1.2) Let \(G\) be a group and let \(a, b \in G\). If \(ab = e\), then \(a = b^{-1}\). Likewise, if \(ba = e\), then \(b = a^{-1}\). By definition, \(b\) an inverse of \(a\) if \(ab = ba = e\) so it’s an inverse on both sides. This proposition proposes that checking only one side is enough. That is if \(ab = e\), then \(a = b^{-1}\) and \(b\) is the inverse. So what we want to show here is that given \(ba = e\), then \(b\) is the inverse of \(a\). We don’t check the other side. One side is enough to imply the other. Proof We know from the previous proposition that \(a\) has an inverse \(a^{-1} \in G\). Now consider the expression \(a^{-1}ab\). By associativity, we can reduce this expression in two ways $$ \begin{align*} (a^{-1}a)b &amp;= a^{-1}(ab) \end{align*} $$ The left hand side $$ \begin{align*} (a^{-1}a)b &amp;= eb = b \end{align*} $$ The right hand side is $$ \begin{align*} a^{-1}(ab) &amp;= a^{-1} \end{align*} $$ So \(b = a^{-1}\) and therefore, \(ba = a^{-1}a = e\). Proof (Book) Suppose \(hg = e\), then $$ \begin{align*} h = h(gg^{-1}) = (hg)g^{-1}= eg^{-1} = g^{-1}. \end{align*} $$ Suppose now that \(gh = e\), then $$ \begin{align*} g = g(hh^{-1}) = (gh)h^{-1} = eh^{-1} = h^{-1}. \ \blacksquare \end{align*} $$ Corollary 2.1.3 Let \(g\) be an element of a group \(G\). We have \(g = (g^{-1})^{-1}\) Proof We know \(gg^{-1} = e\). By (2.1.2) \(g = (g^{-1})^{-1}\). \(\ \blacksquare\) Proposition 2.1.4 Let \(G\) be a group and let \(a,b \in G\). Then We have \((ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}\) Proof Notice that \((ab)(b^{-1}a^{-1}) = a(b((b^{-1}a^{-1})) = a((bb^{-1})a^{-1}) = a(ea^{-1}) = aa^{-1} = e\). Therefore, \((ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}\).

Definition (Book Definition 1.7.1)
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Given integers \(a\) and \(b\), and a natural number \(n\), we say that "\(a\) is congruent to \(b\) modulo \(n\)" and we write 
$$
\begin{align*}
a \equiv b \bmod n \quad \text{or} \quad a \equiv_n b
\end{align*}
$$
if \(a - b\) is divisible by \(n\) or \(n \ | \ a - b\). So there exists some \(t \in \mathbf{Z}\) such that \(a - b = tn\)
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><br />
<br />
Example: \((1 \bmod 7) = (8 \bmod 7) = 1\). Therefore, \(1 \equiv_7 8\).

<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
For each integer \(a\), write
$$
\begin{align*}
[a] &amp;= [a]_n = \{x \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ x \equiv a \bmod n\} \subseteq \mathbf{Z} \\
    &amp;= \{ a + ny \ | \ y \in \mathbf{Z} \}

The set \([a]\) is called the residue class or congruence class of \(a\) modulo \(n\).

Example: \([2]_6 = \{2 + 6y \ | \ y \in \mathbf{Z}\} = \{ ...,-10,-4,2,8,14,20,... \}\)
<br />
\([2]_6 = [8]_6 = [-10]_6 = [602]_6 = ....\)

<h4><b>The Remainder Function</b></h4>
<p>Another important definition that we need is the following
<br />
<br /></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
	\(rem_n \ : \ \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \{0,1,2,...,n-1\}\) is the remainder function after dividing by \(n\).
	<br />
	\(rem_n(a) = r\) is the unique remainder of \(a \div n\) such that \(0 \leq r &lt; n\) and \(a = qn + r\) for some \(q \in \mathbf{Z}\). Note that \(a - r\) is divisible by \(n\) or \(a \equiv_n r\).
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><br />
It’s important to note that the remainder is in the same congruence class as \(a\). In fact \([a]_n \cap \{0,...n-1\} = \{r\}\). Usually the remainder \(r\) is the standard/canonical name for the congruence class. So for example, we usually don’t write \([602]_6\) but write \([2]_6\). But we don’t have to put it in canonical form.

<h4><b>Properties of Congruence</b></h4>
<p>Congruence is an equivalence relation. The following properties show this.
<br />
<br />
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Lemma (Book 1.7.2)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
	Properties of Congruence:
<ol>
	<li>Reflexive: For all \(a \in \mathbf{Z}\), \(a \equiv a \bmod n\).</li>
	<li>Symmetric: For all \(a, b \in \mathbf{Z}\), \(a \equiv b \bmod n\) if and only if \(b \equiv a \bmod n\).</li>
	<li>Transitive: For all \(a, b, c \in \mathbf{Z}\), if \(a \equiv b \bmod n\) and \(b \equiv c \bmod n\), then \(a \equiv c \bmod n\).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<b>Proof (book)</b>
<br />
For \((a)\), \(a - a = 0\) is divisible by \(n\). For \((b)\), if \(a - b\) is divisible by \(n\), then \(b - a\) is also divisible by \(n\) and vice versa. For \((c)\), if \(a - b\) is divisible by \(n\) and \(b - c\) is divisible by \(4n\), then \((a - b) + (b - c) = a - c\) is also divisible by \(n\). \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
Based on these properties, we have the following proposition
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Proposition (Book Lemma 1.7.3)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
For \(a, b \in \mathbf{Z}\), the following are equivalent:

	<li>\([a]_n \cap [b]_n \neq \emptyset\).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<b>Proof (Book):</b>
<br />
\((a) \implies (b)\):
<br />
Suppose \(a \equiv b \bmod n\). We want to show that \([a]_n = [b]_n\). 
<br />
\([a]_n \subseteq [b]_n\): Let \(c \in \mathbf{Z}\). If \(c \equiv a \bmod n\), then \(c \equiv b \bmod n\) by Lemma 1.7.2 (c). Therefore \([a]_n \subseteq [b]_n\).
<br />
\([b]_n \subseteq [a]_n\): If \(c \equiv b \bmod n\), then \(c \equiv a \bmod n\) and so \([a] = [b]\) as required.
<br />
<br />
\((b) \implies (c)\):
<br />
By definition, \(\text{rem}_n(x)\) is the unique element of \([x]\) that lies inside \(\{0,1,...,n-1\}\). So if \([a]_n=[b]_n\), then it must be the same element.
<br />
<br />
\((c) \implies (d)\):
<br />
\((d)\) is an immediate application of \((c)\)
<br />
<br />
\((d) \implies (a)\):
Suppose that \([a]_n \cap [b]_n \neq \emptyset\). Let \(c \in [a]_n \cap [b]_n\). Then \(a \equiv c \bmod n\) and \(b \equiv c \bmod n\). But this implies that \(a \equiv b \bmod n\). \(\ \blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Modular Arithmetic</b></h4>
<p>The following lemma establishes how modular arithmetic is done.
<br /></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Proposition (Book Lemma 1.7.5)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(a, a', b, b'\) be integers with \(a \equiv a' \bmod n\) and \(b \equiv b' \bmod n\). Then

ab &amp;\equiv a'b' \bmod n

Only some elements \([a] \in \mathbf{Z}_n\) have a multiplicative inverse. (such that \([a][b] = [1] = [b][a]\)). The question is when do we have a multiplicative inverse? The answer is in the following proposition.

<div class="peachheaderdiv">

<h4><b>Binomial Theorem</b></h4>
<p><br />
Next we have the binomial theorem which we need to prove a proposition which will then lead to Fermat’s Little Theorem.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem (Binomial Theorem)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
	\(a, b \in \mathbf{R}, n \in \mathbf{N}\). Then
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
	\end{align*}
	$$
	where \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\) for \(a \leq k \leq n\)
</div>
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Use Pascal’s Identity: \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k} + \binom{n-1}{k-1}\)… TODO
<br />
<br />
As a consequence of the binomial theorem, we have the next proposition
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(p\) be prime. For all \(a, b \in \mathbf{Z}\):
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(a + b)^p \equiv a^p + b^p \bmod p
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p><br />
<br />
First observe that \((a+b)^5 = a^5 + 5a^4b + 10a^3b^2 + 10a^2b^3 + 5ab^4 + b^5\). So those middle terms all have coefficients divisible by 5. Therefore, they’ll go away if we apply mod \(5\). This happens when \(p\) is prime.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Using the binomial theorem, we can first expand the sum \((a+b)^p\) as follows</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(a + b)^p &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{p}{k} a^{p-k} b^k \\
	          &amp;= a^{p} + \binom{p}{1} a^{p-1} b + \binom{p}{2} a^{p-2} b^2 + ... + b^k \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>What we need to show is that \(\binom{p}{k} \equiv 0 \bmod p\) if \(0 &lt; k &lt; p\). If we show this, then what’s left is the first and last terms only. Observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\binom{p}{k} &amp;= \frac{p!}{k!(p-k)!} \\
	\binom{p}{k} k! (p-k)! &amp;= p! \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(p! = p(p-1)...1\). So \(p \ | \ p!\). But \(p! = \binom{p}{k} k! (p-k)!\) so \(p\) divides this whole product. Since \(p\) is prime, then \(p\) must divide one of the factors. Now observe that \(p\) can’t divide \(k!\) since \(k &lt; p\). \(p\) doesn’t divide \((p - k)!\) either since \(p - k &lt; p\). Therefore, \(p\) must divide \(\binom{p}{k}\) as desired. \(\ \blacksquare\).

<b>Proof of (2)</b>
<br />
We are given that \(a \nmid p\). From part (1), we know that \(a^p \equiv a \bmod p\). So \(p \ | \ a^p - a = a(a^{p-1} - 1)\). But since \(p\) is prime and since it doesn’t divide \(p\), then it must divide \(a^{p-1} - 1\).

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We know that \(h \equiv 1 \bmod m\) so \(h = 1 + tm\) for some \(t \in \mathbf{Z}\). We want to show that \(a^h \equiv a \bmod n\). In other words, we want to show that \(n \ | \ a^h - a\) which means that \(pq \ | \ a^h - a\). We can write \(a^h - a\) as follows</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	   a^h - a &amp;= a^{1+tm} - a \\
	           &amp;= a(a^{tm} - 1).
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Therefore, want to show that \(pq\) divides \(a(a^{tm} - 1)\). Lecture 5 Proposition (Corollary 1.6.17 in the book) states that if \(a\) and \(b\) are relatively prime, \(a \ | \ n\) and \(b \ | \ n\), \(ab \ | \ n\). We’re given that \(p\) and \(q\) are distinct primes so they are relatively prime. So the goal is to prove that \(p\) divides \(a(a^{tm} - 1)\) and \(q\) divides \(a(a^{tm} - 1)\) to conclude that the product \(pq\) divides \(a(a^{tm} - 1)\).
<br />
<br />
To start, we want to show that \(p \ | \ a(a^{tm} - 1)\). But since \(p\) is prime, then it will have to divide \(a\) or \(a^{tm} - 1\). So we need to show that either \(p \ | \ a\) or \(p \ | \ a^{tm} - 1\). So suppose that \(p \nmid a\). We claim that \(p \ | \ a^{tm} - 1\). Recall that \(m = lcm(p-1, q-1)\). So \(m\) is a multiple of \(p-1\) and we can write \(m = (p - 1)s\) for some \(s \in \mathbf{N}\). So now we can write \(a^{tm}\) as follows</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	   a^{tm} &amp;= a^{ts(p-1)} \\
	              &amp;= (a^{p-1})^{ts}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Since we assumed that \(p \nmid a\). Then we can use Fermat’s Little Theorem (part 2) to conclude that \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \bmod p\). Now we can use modular arithmetic to simplify the original expression.</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	   (a^{p-1})^{ts} &amp;\equiv 1^{ts} \bmod p \text{ (because } a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \bmod p) \\
	                  &amp;\equiv 1 \bmod p.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This implies that \(a^{tm} - 1\) must be divisible by \(p\) as we wanted to show. So \(p\) divides the product \(a(a^{tm} - 1)\). With a similar argument, we can show this for \(q\).

<h4><b>RSA Cryptosystem</b></h4>
<p>This encryption method is based on the two prime fermat theorem. It is widely used to encrypt many of the transactions that happen on the internet.
<br />
<br />
Symmetric Encryption:
We have some plain text (\(x \in \mathbf{Z}_n\)) that we want to encrypt. We have a function that takes a key (\(e \in \mathbf{Z}\)) to encrypt the plain text and turn it to encrypted text (\(y \in \mathbf{Z}_n\)). To decrypt it back, we have to use the same key again to turn it to plain text. The flaw in this method is that the encryption and decryption keys are the same and will need to be shared somehow. That’s why we have an alternative:
<br />
<br />
Asymmetric Encryption:
This is the same proces except that now we have a decryption key \((d \in \mathbf{Z})\). So now we have a pair of keys \((e, d)\). You will broadcast \(e\) so that anyone can encrypt a message and send it to you, but you are the only with the decryption key. The goal here is to design the pair such that one one can deduce \(d\) from \(e\). So how to design such a pair?
<br />
<br />
One way to implement this idea is the following (RSA):</p>
<ol>
	<li>Pick a prime number \(p,q\) large (100s of digits)</li>
	<li>\(n = pq\)</li>
	<li>\(m = lcm(p-1,q-1)\)</li>
	<li>Choose \(1 &lt; d, e &lt; m\) such that \(de \equiv 1 \bmod m\). You can first pick \(d\) and then you can pick a multiplicative inverse of \(d\) to be \(e\) using the Euclidean Algorithm.</li>
</ol>
<p>So now, you take the plain test \(x\) and raise it to the \(e\)th power. \(x^e\) is the encrypted text. \(e\) is the encryption key. The output \(y = x^e\) is the encrypted text. To decrypt it, raise the encrypted text to the \(d\)th power so \(y^d = x^{ed}\) and so now we have the following equation</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	  x^{ed} \equiv x \bmod pq
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is Two-prime Fermat.

So there exists some \(t \in \mathbf{Z}\) such that \(a - b = tn\) Example: \((1 \bmod 7) = (8 \bmod 7) = 1\). Therefore, \(1 \equiv_7 8\). Definition For each integer \(a\), write $$ \begin{align*} [a] &amp;= [a]_n = \{x \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ x \equiv a \bmod n\} \subseteq \mathbf{Z} \\ &amp;= \{ a + ny \ | \ y \in \mathbf{Z} \} \end{align*} $$ The set \([a]\) is called the residue class or congruence class of \(a\) modulo \(n\). Example: \([2]_6 = \{2 + 6y \ | \ y \in \mathbf{Z}\} = \{ ...,-10,-4,2,8,14,20,... \}\) \([2]_6 = [8]_6 = [-10]_6 = [602]_6 = ....\) The Remainder Function Another important definition that we need is the following Definition \(rem_n \ : \ \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \{0,1,2,...,n-1\}\) is the remainder function after dividing by \(n\). \(rem_n(a) = r\) is the unique remainder of \(a \div n\) such that \(0 \leq r &lt; n\) and \(a = qn + r\) for some \(q \in \mathbf{Z}\). Note that \(a - r\) is divisible by \(n\) or \(a \equiv_n r\). It’s important to note that the remainder is in the same congruence class as \(a\). In fact \([a]_n \cap \{0,...n-1\} = \{r\}\). Usually the remainder \(r\) is the standard/canonical name for the congruence class. So for example, we usually don’t write \([602]_6\) but write \([2]_6\). But we don’t have to put it in canonical form. Properties of Congruence Congruence is an equivalence relation. The following properties show this. Lemma (Book 1.7.2) Properties of Congruence: Reflexive: For all \(a \in \mathbf{Z}\), \(a \equiv a \bmod n\). Symmetric: For all \(a, b \in \mathbf{Z}\), \(a \equiv b \bmod n\) if and only if \(b \equiv a \bmod n\). Transitive: For all \(a, b, c \in \mathbf{Z}\), if \(a \equiv b \bmod n\) and \(b \equiv c \bmod n\), then \(a \equiv c \bmod n\). Proof (book) For \((a)\), \(a - a = 0\) is divisible by \(n\). For \((b)\), if \(a - b\) is divisible by \(n\), then \(b - a\) is also divisible by \(n\) and vice versa. For \((c)\), if \(a - b\) is divisible by \(n\) and \(b - c\) is divisible by \(4n\), then \((a - b) + (b - c) = a - c\) is also divisible by \(n\). \(\ \blacksquare\) Based on these properties, we have the following proposition Proposition (Book Lemma 1.7.3) For \(a, b \in \mathbf{Z}\), the following are equivalent: \(a \equiv b \bmod n\). \([a]_n = [b]_n\). \(\text{rem}_n(a) = \text{rem}_n(b)\). \([a]_n \cap [b]_n \neq \emptyset\). Proof (Book): \((a) \implies (b)\): Suppose \(a \equiv b \bmod n\). We want to show that \([a]_n = [b]_n\). \([a]_n \subseteq [b]_n\): Let \(c \in \mathbf{Z}\). If \(c \equiv a \bmod n\), then \(c \equiv b \bmod n\) by Lemma 1.7.2 (c). Therefore \([a]_n \subseteq [b]_n\). \([b]_n \subseteq [a]_n\): If \(c \equiv b \bmod n\), then \(c \equiv a \bmod n\) and so \([a] = [b]\) as required. \((b) \implies (c)\): By definition, \(\text{rem}_n(x)\) is the unique element of \([x]\) that lies inside \(\{0,1,...,n-1\}\). So if \([a]_n=[b]_n\), then it must be the same element. \((c) \implies (d)\): \((d)\) is an immediate application of \((c)\) \((d) \implies (a)\): Suppose that \([a]_n \cap [b]_n \neq \emptyset\). Let \(c \in [a]_n \cap [b]_n\). Then \(a \equiv c \bmod n\) and \(b \equiv c \bmod n\). But this implies that \(a \equiv b \bmod n\). \(\ \blacksquare\) Modular Arithmetic The following lemma establishes how modular arithmetic is done. Proposition (Book Lemma 1.7.5) Let \(a, a', b, b'\) be integers with \(a \equiv a' \bmod n\) and \(b \equiv b' \bmod n\). Then $$ \begin{align*} a + b &amp;\equiv a' + b' \bmod n \\ ab &amp;\equiv a'b' \bmod n \end{align*} $$ Proof [TODO] We can now use these modular arithmetic properties to define algebraic structures on a set. Definition $$ \begin{align*} \mathbf{Z}_n &amp;= \{ \text{ set of congruence classes mod } n \} \\ &amp;= \{ [a]_n \ | \ a \in \mathbf{Z} \} \\ &amp;= \{ [0]_n, [1]_n,...,[n-1]_n \ | \ a \in \mathbf{Z} \} \\ \end{align*} $$ So now we can use the operations we defined previously to turn this set into a commutative ring. Definition Define operations \(+\), \(\cdot\) on \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) by $$ \begin{align*} [a]_n + [b]_n &amp;= [a + b]_n \\ [a]_n[b]_n &amp;= [ab]_n \end{align*} $$ \((\mathbf{Z}_n,+,\cdot)\) is commutative ring with identity while \((\mathbf{Z}_n,\cdot)\) is a commutative monoid. \([1]\) is the identity element. Only some elements \([a] \in \mathbf{Z}_n\) have a multiplicative inverse. (such that \([a][b] = [1] = [b][a]\)). The question is when do we have a multiplicative inverse? The answer is in the following proposition. Proposition Let \(n \geq 1, a \in \mathbf{Z}\). Then \([a]\) has a multiplicative inverse in \(\mathbf{Z}\) if and only if \(gcd(a,n) = 1\). Proof Suppose that \(gcd(a,n)=1\). Then there exists \(r, s \in \mathbf{Z}\) such that \(ar + ns = 1\). Re-writing this equation, we observe that $$ \begin{align*} ar + ns = 1 &amp;\Longleftrightarrow ar = 1 + (-s)n \quad \text{ (so $ar$ and 1 differ by a multiple of $n$)}\\ &amp;\Longleftrightarrow ar = 1 \bmod n \\ &amp;\Longleftrightarrow [a][r] = 1. \ \blacksquare \\ \end{align*} $$ We will use \(\phi(n) = \{x \in \mathbf{Z}_n \ | \ x \text{ has a multiplicative inverse}\} \in \mathbf{Z}_n\). \((\phi(n))\) is a commutative group. Binomial Theorem Next we have the binomial theorem which we need to prove a proposition which will then lead to Fermat’s Little Theorem. Theorem (Binomial Theorem) \(a, b \in \mathbf{R}, n \in \mathbf{N}\). Then $$ \begin{align*} (a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k \end{align*} $$ where \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\) for \(a \leq k \leq n\) Proof Use Pascal’s Identity: \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k} + \binom{n-1}{k-1}\)… TODO As a consequence of the binomial theorem, we have the next proposition Proposition Let \(p\) be prime. For all \(a, b \in \mathbf{Z}\): $$ \begin{align*} (a + b)^p \equiv a^p + b^p \bmod p \end{align*} $$ First observe that \((a+b)^5 = a^5 + 5a^4b + 10a^3b^2 + 10a^2b^3 + 5ab^4 + b^5\). So those middle terms all have coefficients divisible by 5. Therefore, they’ll go away if we apply mod \(5\). This happens when \(p\) is prime. Proof Using the binomial theorem, we can first expand the sum \((a+b)^p\) as follows $$ \begin{align*} (a + b)^p &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{p}{k} a^{p-k} b^k \\ &amp;= a^{p} + \binom{p}{1} a^{p-1} b + \binom{p}{2} a^{p-2} b^2 + ... + b^k \\ \end{align*} $$ What we need to show is that \(\binom{p}{k} \equiv 0 \bmod p\) if \(0 &lt; k &lt; p\). If we show this, then what’s left is the first and last terms only. Observe that $$ \begin{align*} \binom{p}{k} &amp;= \frac{p!}{k!(p-k)!} \\ \binom{p}{k} k! (p-k)! &amp;= p! \\ \end{align*} $$ \(p! = p(p-1)...1\). So \(p \ | \ p!\). But \(p! = \binom{p}{k} k! (p-k)!\) so \(p\) divides this whole product. Since \(p\) is prime, then \(p\) must divide one of the factors. Now observe that \(p\) can’t divide \(k!\) since \(k &lt; p\). \(p\) doesn’t divide \((p - k)!\) either since \(p - k &lt; p\). Therefore, \(p\) must divide \(\binom{p}{k}\) as desired. \(\ \blacksquare\). A consequence of this proof is Fermat’s Little Theorem Fermat's Little Theorem Next, we will prove Fermat’s Little Theorem. Theorem Let \(p\) be prime, \(a \in \mathbf{Z}\) \(a^p \equiv a \bmod p\) If \(p \nmid a\), then \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \bmod p\) Proof of (1) By Induction on \(a\) for \(a \geq 1\). Base Case (\(a = 1\)): \(1^p \equiv 1 \bmod p\) and so we're done. Inductive Case (\(a &gt; 1\)): Assume it is true for \(a\). We will show that it is true for \(a+1\). $$ \begin{align*} (a + 1)^p &amp;\equiv a^p + 1^p \quad \text{(By the previous proposition)} \\ &amp;\equiv a + 1 \quad \text{(By the inductive hypothesis)} \end{align*} $$ Note that if \(a = 0\), then \(0^p = 0\). For \(a \leq 0\), we can use downward induction. By Induction on \(a\) for \(a &lt; 0\). Base Case (\(a = -1\)): We need to show that \((-1)^p \equiv -1 \bmod p\). \(p\) is prime so we have two cases. If \(p = 2\), then \((-1)^2 = 1 = -1 \bmod 2\). If \(p\) is odd, then \((-1)^p = -1\). Inductive Case (\(a &lt; -1\)): We want to show that \(a^p \equiv a\) implies \((a - 1)^p = a - 1\). Proof of (2) We are given that \(a \nmid p\). From part (1), we know that \(a^p \equiv a \bmod p\). So \(p \ | \ a^p - a = a(a^{p-1} - 1)\). But since \(p\) is prime and since it doesn’t divide \(p\), then it must divide \(a^{p-1} - 1\). Two-Prime Fermat There is a more generalized version of Fermat’s Little Theorem. We will use Fermat’s theorem to prove it. Theorem Let \(p, q\) be distinct primes and let \(n = pq\). Let \(m\) be $$ \begin{align*} m = lcm(p-1, q-1) = \frac{(p-1)(q-1)}{gcd(p-1,q-1)} \end{align*} $$ If \(a \in \mathbf{Z}\), \(h \in \mathbf{N}\) such that \(h \equiv 1 \bmod m\), then \(a^h \equiv a \bmod n\) Proof We know that \(h \equiv 1 \bmod m\) so \(h = 1 + tm\) for some \(t \in \mathbf{Z}\). We want to show that \(a^h \equiv a \bmod n\). In other words, we want to show that \(n \ | \ a^h - a\) which means that \(pq \ | \ a^h - a\). We can write \(a^h - a\) as follows $$ \begin{align*} a^h - a &amp;= a^{1+tm} - a \\ &amp;= a(a^{tm} - 1). \end{align*} $$ Therefore, want to show that \(pq\) divides \(a(a^{tm} - 1)\). Lecture 5 Proposition (Corollary 1.6.17 in the book) states that if \(a\) and \(b\) are relatively prime, \(a \ | \ n\) and \(b \ | \ n\), \(ab \ | \ n\). We’re given that \(p\) and \(q\) are distinct primes so they are relatively prime. So the goal is to prove that \(p\) divides \(a(a^{tm} - 1)\) and \(q\) divides \(a(a^{tm} - 1)\) to conclude that the product \(pq\) divides \(a(a^{tm} - 1)\). To start, we want to show that \(p \ | \ a(a^{tm} - 1)\). But since \(p\) is prime, then it will have to divide \(a\) or \(a^{tm} - 1\). So we need to show that either \(p \ | \ a\) or \(p \ | \ a^{tm} - 1\). So suppose that \(p \nmid a\). We claim that \(p \ | \ a^{tm} - 1\). Recall that \(m = lcm(p-1, q-1)\). So \(m\) is a multiple of \(p-1\) and we can write \(m = (p - 1)s\) for some \(s \in \mathbf{N}\). So now we can write \(a^{tm}\) as follows $$ \begin{align*} a^{tm} &amp;= a^{ts(p-1)} \\ &amp;= (a^{p-1})^{ts}. \end{align*} $$ Since we assumed that \(p \nmid a\). Then we can use Fermat’s Little Theorem (part 2) to conclude that \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \bmod p\). Now we can use modular arithmetic to simplify the original expression. $$ \begin{align*} (a^{p-1})^{ts} &amp;\equiv 1^{ts} \bmod p \text{ (because } a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \bmod p) \\ &amp;\equiv 1 \bmod p. \end{align*} $$ This implies that \(a^{tm} - 1\) must be divisible by \(p\) as we wanted to show. So \(p\) divides the product \(a(a^{tm} - 1)\). With a similar argument, we can show this for \(q\). RSA Cryptosystem This encryption method is based on the two prime fermat theorem.
