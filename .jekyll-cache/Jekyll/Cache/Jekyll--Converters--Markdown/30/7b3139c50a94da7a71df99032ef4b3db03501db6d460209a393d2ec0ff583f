If $n \in N,$ then $1 + (-1)^n(2n-1)$ is a multiple of $4$.

<hr />

<p><br />
<b>Proof.</b><br />
Suppose $n \in N$. We know $n$ is either odd or even. Consider the following cases:<br />
<b>Case 1: Suppose $n$ is odd. Then $n = 2k + 1$ for some $k \in Z$ and $1 + (-1)^{(2k+1)}(2n-1)$ </b>
<br />
<b>Case 2: Suppose $n$ is even. </b></p>

\begin{align*}
gcd(a,b) = gcd(a,b-a) = gcd(a,b+a)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Proof: Let \(gcd(a,b) = d \in Z\). By the defintion of \(gcd\) we know that \(d \ | \ a\) and \(d \ | \ b\). Therefore, for some \(x, y \in Z\), we have \(a = xd\) and, \(b = yd\). From this we have, \(a - b = d(x - y)\). Therefore, we know that \(d = gcd(a,b) \ | \ a - b\).</p>
