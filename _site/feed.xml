<br />
<br /></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \(A = \{x \in \mathbf{R}: x &lt; 0\}\). We will use <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/05/analysis-least-upper-bound-epsilon.html">lemma 1.3.8</a> to prove that \(\sup(A) = 0\). First, 0 is an upper bound of the set \(A\) since by definition the set \(A\) is the set of real numbers less than 0. Next, we need to prove that there exists an element \(a \in A\) such that for every choice of \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), we have</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a &amp;&gt; \sup(A) - \epsilon \\
a &amp;&gt; 0 - \epsilon \\
a &amp;&gt; -\epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Pick \(a = -\epsilon/2\). First note that since \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), then \(-\epsilon/2 &lt; 0\) and therefore \(-\epsilon/2 \in A\). Now let’s prove that this choice will lead to having \(a &gt; -\epsilon\) as required. Start with</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\epsilon &amp;&gt; 0 \\
\epsilon -2\epsilon &amp;&gt; 0 - 2\epsilon \\
-\epsilon &amp;&gt; -2\epsilon \\
-\epsilon/2 &amp;&gt; -\epsilon
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Therefore, setting \(a = -\epsilon/2\) has the property that \(a \in A\) and also that \(a &gt; 0 - \epsilon\) for any choice of \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) which proves that \(\sup(A) = 0\) as required by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/05/analysis-least-upper-bound-epsilon.html">lemma 1.3.8</a>.

<br />
<br /></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \(A\) be the set defined above. We claim that \(\sup A = \frac{1}{2}\). To see this, we need to prove that \(1/2\) is an upper bound and then prove that \(1/2\) is the least upper bound.
<br />
<br />
To prove that 1/2 is an upper bound, we’ll assume for the sake of contradiction that it is not. Therefore,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
1/2 &lt; \frac{(-1)^n}{n} \\
n/2 &lt; (-1)^n.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>If we let $n = 1$, then we’ll see that \(1/2 &lt; -1\) which is a contradiction so \(1/2\) is an upper bound. To prove that \(1/2\) is the least upper bound, we’ll use lemma 1.3.8 which states  that \(s = \sup A\) iff for all \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), there exist an element \(a \in A\) such that \(a &gt; s - \epsilon\).</p>

<p>So I need to find an $n$ such that if we pick any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, then we’ll see that \(\frac{(-1)^n}{n} &gt; 1/2 - \epsilon\)</p>

<p>I was thinking for strategy 2, we pick $n = 2$ and so
\(\frac{(-1)^2}{2} &gt; 1/2 - \epsilon \\
  \frac{1}{2} &gt; 1/2 - \epsilon\)
This is true for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. So 1/2 is the least upper bound.

<br />
<br /></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \(A\) and \(B\) be nonempty and bounded sets of real numbers sets such that \(A \subseteq B\). We will prove the following</p>
<ul>
<li>\(\sup A \leq \sup B\)</li>
<li>\(\inf A \leq \sup A\)</li>
<li>\(\inf B \leq \inf A\)</li>
</ul>
<p>From these inequalities we can then conclude that \(\inf B \leq \inf A \leq \sup A \leq \sup B\). To prove \(\sup A \leq \sup B\), let \(a \in A\). We know that \(a \leq \sup A\) by the definition of least upper bound. But since \(A \subseteq B\) then each element of \(A\) is also in \(B\) so \(\sup B\) is an upper bound on the set \(A\) and \(a \leq sup B\). Finally, we know that for any other upper bound \(y\) on the set \(A\) that \(\sup A\) is less than or equal \(y\) since \(\sup A\) is the least upper bound. This means that \(\sup A \leq \sup B\). (So the idea is just to prove that \(\sup B\) is an upper bound on \(A\) here and then everything will come together.)
<br />
<br />
To prove that \(\inf A \leq \sup A\). By definition we know \(\inf A \leq a\) and \(a \leq \sup A\). So \(\inf A \leq a \leq \sup A\) and \(\inf A \leq \sup A\).
<br />
<br />
To prove the last piece \(\inf B \leq inf A\), let \(a\) be an arbitrary element of \(A\). We know \(\inf A \leq a\) by the defintion of the greatest lower bound. But \(A \subseteq B\) so \(a\) is also an element of \(B\) and \(\inf B \leq a\). This means that \(\inf B\) is a lower bound on \(A\). By the definition of the greatest lower bound we know that for any other lower bound \(x\), we must have \(\inf A \geq x\). Therefore we can conclude that \(\inf A \geq \inf B\). This is the last piece of the proof and therefore \(\inf B \leq \inf A \leq \sup A \leq \sup B\).

For the definitions of an upper bound and the least upper bound of a set see <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">this</a>.
<br /></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \(A, B \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) be nonempty and bounded above. By the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/03/analysis-set-bounded.html">Axiom of Completeness</a>, \(\sup A\) and \(\sup B\) both exist. We claim that that \(\sup (A \cup B) = \sup (\{\sup A, \sup B\})\). Since \(\sup A\) and \(\sup B\) both exist, then the set \(\{\sup A, \sup B\}\) is nonempty and bounded above. Therefore, \(\sup (A \cup B)\) also exists by the Axiom of Completeness.
<br />
<br />
Without the loss of generality, suppose that \(\sup A \geq \sup B\). If that’s the case, then \(\sup (\{\sup A, \sup B\}) = \sup A\). (Why? because the maximum of the set is the supremum of the set. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bLaGzeTMkY">proof</a> for this is straight forward). So now the goal is to prove that \(\sup (A \cup B) = \sup A\). To do this, we will prove that</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(\sup (A \cup B) \geq \sup A\)</li>
	<li>\(\sup (A \cup B) \leq \sup A\)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first inequality, we want to prove that \(\sup (A \cup B)\) is an upper bound on the set \(A\). First, \(\sup(A \cup B)\) is an upper bound on the set \(A \cup B\) (by the definition of the least upper bound). But we know that \(A \subseteq A \cup B\). Therefore, \(\sup(A \cup B)\) is an upper bound on the set \(A\) as well. Second, we know that \(\sup A\) must be less than or equal to any other upper bound by the definition of the least upper bound. Therefore \(\sup A \leq \sup(A \cup B)\).
<br />
<br />
For the second inequality, suppose for the sake of contradiction that it is not the case that \(\sup (A \cup B) \leq \sup A\). So \(\sup (A \cup B) &gt; \sup A\). This means that \(\sup A\) is not an upper bound on the set \(A \cup B\). Therefore, there must exists some element \(b \in B\) such that \(b &gt; \sup A\). But we know by the definition of the least upper bound that \(\sup B \geq b\). So now we have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup A &lt; b \leq \sup B
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This is a contradiction since we assumed that \(\sup A &gt; \sup B\) and therefore we must have \(\sup (A \cup B) \leq \sup A\) as required. \(\blacksquare\)

<br /></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \(A\) and \(B\) be sets and let \(A + B\) be the set defined above. We want to prove that \(\sup A+B = \sup A + \sup B\). To do this, we will prove:</p>
<ul> 
	<li>\(\sup (A+B) \leq \sup A + \sup B\).</li> 
	<li>\(\sup (A+B) \geq \sup A + \sup B\).</li>
</ul>
<p>From these two inequalities we will then conclude that \(\sup A+B = \sup A + \sup B\). To prove that \(\sup A+B \leq \sup A + \sup B\), let \(a\) be an arbitrary element in \(A\). Then we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a &amp;\leq \sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Similarly, Let \(b\) be an arbitrary element in \(B\). Then we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
b &amp;\leq \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Adding both inequalities will result in</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a + b &amp;\leq \sup A + \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Since \(a\) and \(b\) were arbitrary, this means that \(\sup A + \sup B\) is an upper bound for \(A + B\). But we know the least upper bound for \(A+B\) is \(\sup A + B\) and by the definition of the least upper bound \(\sup A + B\) must be less than or equal to any other bound on \(A + B\). Therefore we can write,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup (A+B) &amp;\leq \sup A + \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>And this concludes the first part of the proof. To prove condition two, define an arbitrary \(\epsilon &gt; 0\). By <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/05/analysis-least-upper-bound-epsilon.html">lemma 1.3.8</a> we know that there exists some element \(x \in A\) such that,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
x &gt; \sup A - \epsilon/2.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>(Side note: the lemma states that \(\sup A\) is a least upper bound iff for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), there exists some element in \(A\) such that \(a &gt; \sup - \epsilon\) so really any tiny epsilon taken away from \(\sup A\) will render it not a least upper bound anymore)<br />Similarly, there exists an element \(y \in B\) such that,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
y &gt; \sup B - \epsilon/2.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Adding both inequalities we see,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
x + y &gt; \sup A + \sup B - \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>But from part 1 of the proof we know that \(\sup A + \sup B\) is an upper bound for \(A+B\) where we saw that if for any arbitrary elements \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\), we have</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a + b \leq \sup A + \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So we have two things. First \(\sup A + \sup B\) is an upper bound on \(A+B\). Second, we proved above that for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), there exists some elements \(x \in A\) and \(y \in B\) such that \(x + y &gt; \sup A + \sup B - \epsilon\). So by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/05/analysis-least-upper-bound-epsilon.html">lemma 1.3.8</a>, \(\sup A + \sup B\) is a least upper bound for \(A + B\) and so we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup A + \sup B \leq \sup (A + B).
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>as required. \(\blacksquare\)

<p>Let \(A\) and \(B\) be sets and let \(A + B\) be the set defined above. We want to prove that \(\sup A+B = \sup A + \sup B\). To do this, we will prove:</p>
<ul>

	<li>\(\sup (A+B) \geq \sup A + \sup B\).</li>
</ul>
<p>From these two inequalities we will then conclude that \(\sup A+B = \sup A + \sup B\).
<br />
<br />
To prove that \(\sup A+B \leq \sup A + \sup B\), let \(a\) be an arbitrary element in \(A\). Then we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a &amp;\leq \sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Similarly, Let \(b\) be an arbitrary element in \(B\). Then we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
b &amp;\leq \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Adding both inequalities will result in</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a + b &amp;\leq \sup A + \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Since \(a\) and \(b\) were arbitrary, this means that \(\sup A + \sup B\) is an upper bound for \(A + B\). But we know the least upper bound for \(A+B\) is \(\sup A + B\) and by the definition of the least upper bound \(\sup A + B\) must be less than or equal to any other bound on \(A + B\). Therefore we can write,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup (A+B) &amp;\leq \sup A + \sup B.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>And this concludes the first part of the proof. To prove condition two, let \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\) be arbitrary elements. We know that by the definition of the least upper bound we must have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a + b &amp;\leq \sup (A + B).
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Let’s move \(b\) to the other side of the inequality.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - b.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>\(a\) here is an arbitrary element in \(A\) so \(\sup (A + B) - b\) must be an upper bound for \(A\) by the definition of an upper bound. But we know that \(\sup A\) is the least upper bound and the least upper bound is less than or equal to any other bound. Therefore, we can write,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup A &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - b.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We can move swap \(\sup A\) and \(b\) now to see that,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
b &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - \sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>With the same argument we used previously here we can see that \(\sup (A+B) - \sup A\) is an upper bound for \(B\) since \(b\) is arbitrary and we know that the least upper bound is less than or equal to any other bound. Therefore,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup B &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - \sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Re-arranging the terms gets us,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sup A + \sup B &amp;\leq \sup (A + B).
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>as required. This concludes the second part of the proof. Therefore, \(\sup A + \sup B \leq \sup (A + B)\) as required.
\(\blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Additional Notes:</b></h4>
<p>I struggled with this proof because I was trying to figure out in my head how to transition from \(a + b \leq \sup A + \sup B\) to \(\sup (A+B) \leq \sup A + \sup B\) by trying to swap \(a + b\) with \(\sup (A+B)\). But that not how it works! The first statement establishes that \(\sup A + \sup B\) is some upper bound on \(A+B\). But because the least upper bound is always less than or equal than ANY any other then we can just conclude immediately that \(\sup(A+B) \leq \sup A + \sup B\).

Prove that \(\sup A + B = \sup A + \sup B \) For the definitions of an upper bound and the least upper bound of a set. See This. Proof: Let \(A\) and \(B\) be sets and let \(A + B\) be the set defined above. We want to prove that \(\sup A+B = \sup A + \sup B\). To do this, we will prove: \(\sup (A+B) \leq \sup A + \sup B\). \(\sup (A+B) \geq \sup A + \sup B\). From these two inequalities we will then conclude that \(\sup A+B = \sup A + \sup B\). To prove that \(\sup A+B \leq \sup A + \sup B\), let \(a\) be an arbitrary element in \(A\). Then we must have, $$ \begin{align*} a &amp;\leq \sup A. \end{align*} $$ Similarly, Let \(b\) be an arbitrary element in \(B\). Then we must have, $$ \begin{align*} b &amp;\leq \sup B. \end{align*} $$ Adding both inequalities will result in $$ \begin{align*} a + b &amp;\leq \sup A + \sup B. \end{align*} $$ Since \(a\) and \(b\) were arbitrary, this means that \(\sup A + \sup B\) is an upper bound for \(A + B\). But we know the least upper bound for \(A+B\) is \(\sup A + B\) and by the definition of the least upper bound \(\sup A + B\) must be less than or equal to any other bound on \(A + B\). Therefore we can write, $$ \begin{align*} \sup (A+B) &amp;\leq \sup A + \sup B. \end{align*} $$ And this concludes the first part of the proof. To prove condition two, let \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\) be arbitrary elements. We know that by the definition of the least upper bound we must have, $$ \begin{align*} a + b &amp;\leq \sup (A + B). \end{align*} $$ Let’s move \(b\) to the other side of the inequality. $$ \begin{align*} a &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - b. \end{align*} $$ \(a\) here is an arbitrary element in \(A\) so \(\sup (A + B) - b\) must be an upper bound for \(A\) by the definition of an upper bound. But we know that \(\sup A\) is the least upper bound and the least upper bound is less than or equal to any other bound. Therefore, we can write, $$ \begin{align*} \sup A &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - b. \end{align*} $$ We can move swap \(\sup A\) and \(b\) now to see that, $$ \begin{align*} b &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - \sup A. \end{align*} $$ With the same argument we used previously here we can see that \(\sup (A+B) - \sup A\) is an upper bound for \(B\) since \(b\) is arbitrary and we know that the least upper bound is less than or equal to any other bound. Therefore, $$ \begin{align*} \sup B &amp;\leq \sup (A + B) - \sup A. \end{align*} $$ Re-arranging the terms gets us, $$ \begin{align*} \sup A + \sup B &amp;\leq \sup (A + B). \end{align*} $$ as required. This concludes the second part of the proof. Therefore, \(\sup A + \sup B \leq \sup (A + B)\) as required. \(\blacksquare\) Additional Notes: I struggled with this proof because I was trying to figure out in my head how to transition from \(a + b \leq \sup A + \sup B\) to \(\sup (A+B) \leq \sup A + \sup B\) by trying to swap \(a + b\) with \(\sup (A+B)\). But that not how it works! The first statement establishes that \(\sup A + \sup B\) is some upper bound on \(A+B\). But because the least upper bound is always less than or equal than ANY any other then we can just conclude immediately that \(\sup(A+B) \leq \sup A + \sup B\).
