<b>What is a Random Variable?</b>
<br />
<br />
A random variable is a real-valued function defined on a sample space. Sometimes instead of being interested in the individual outcomes of an experiment, we are interested in some <b>function of the outcome</b>. For example we could be interested in <i>counting</i> the number of heads in <script type="math/tex">5</script> trials of flipping a coin. We can define a random variable <script type="math/tex">Y</script> to represent the number of heads in 5 trials. Using <script type="math/tex">Y</script>, we can now refer to the probability of seeing two heads in 5 trials as <script type="math/tex">P(Y=2)</script> and the probability of seeing at least 3 heads as <script type="math/tex">P(Y\geq3)</script>.
<br />
<br />
We also should note the difference between an event and a random variable. An <b>event</b> is just a particular assignment of a random variable while a random variable takes on numeric values that can be assigned to <i>groups</i> of outcomes in our sample space. Another example is grouping all the outcomes in rolling two dice that sum to 7. We define a random variable <script type="math/tex">X</script> to be the sum of two dice (function of outcomes). We can now refer to the probability that the sum of the dice is 7 sd <script type="math/tex">P(X=7)</script> which is really the probability of seening any of these outcomes: <script type="math/tex">(3,4),(4,3),(2,5),(5,2),(1,6),(6,1)</script>.
<br />
<br />
Example:\</p>

<p>The union of all possible assignments cover the sample space?
mutually exclusive?
[ P(\bigcup_{i}(Y=i)) = \sum_i P(Y=i) = 1 ] 
\end{mdframed}</p>
