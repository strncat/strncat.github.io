Proposition 1.6.18
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(p\) is a prime number and \(a\) is any nonzero integer, then either \(p\) divides \(a\) or \(p\) and \(a\) are relatively prime.
</div>
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
Suppose that $$p$$ is a prime number and $$a$$ is a nonzero integer. Suppose that $$a > 0$$, if not then just consider $$-a$$. $$a$$ can be written as a product of prime numbers $$p_1,...,p_k$$. We have two cases. Either $$p$$ is one of the prime factors of $$a$$ so $$p$$ divides $$a$$. Or $$p$$ is not any of the prime factors of $$a$$. So $$p$$ doesn't divide $$a$$. But since $$p$$ is a prime number, then it won't have any other prime factors and therefore, $$p$$ and $$a$$ are relatively prime. $$\ \blacksquare$$.

Theorem 1.6.21
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
The prime factorization of a natural number is unique.
</div>
<b>Proof</b>
Suppose $$n$$ is a natural number. We want to show that if $$n$$ has the following factorizations
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
n = q_1q_2 ... q_r, \\
n = p_1p_2 ... p_s
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
where $$q_1,...,q_r$$ and $$p_1,...,p_s$$ are prime numbers, $$q_1 \leq ... \leq q_s$$ and $$p_1 \leq ... \leq p_s$$, that these factorizations are the same. In other words, $$r = s$$ and $$q_i = p_i$$ for all $$i$$. We will show this by induction on $$n$$:
<br>
Base Case ($$n = 1$$): 1 can't be written as a product of a non-empty collection of prime numbers. For $$n=2$$, 2 has only one prime factor (itself) since it's a prime number.
<br>
Inductive Case: Suppose the inductive hypothesis is true for any natural number less than $$n$$. Now consider $$n$$ and its factorizations above. Assume without the loss of generality that $$q_1 \leq p_1$$. We know that $$q_1$$ divides $$n$$. By Proposition 1.6.20, $$q_1$$ must divide the product $$p_1p_2...p_s$$. So this means that $$q_1$$ must be equal to one of the factors $$p_1,...,p_s$$. But since $$q_1 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 ... \leq p_k$$, then we must have $$p_1 = q_1$$. So now divide both equations by $$q_1$$ to see that
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
n/q_1 = q_2 ... q_r, \\
n/q_1 = p_2 ... p_s
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
We can now apply the inductive hypothesis to conclude that $$r = s$$ and $$q_i = p_i$$ for all $$i \geq 2$$. $$\ \blacksquare$$.
