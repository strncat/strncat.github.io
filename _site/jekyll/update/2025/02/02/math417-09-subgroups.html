Definition 2.2.1
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
A non-empty subset \(H\) of a group \(G\) is called a subgroup if \(H\) is itself a group with the group operation inherited from \(G\). We write \(H \leq G\) to indicate that \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\).
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><br />
Example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The group \(SO(3)\), the special orthogonal matrices is a subgroup of \(GL_3(\mathbf{R}\), the group of invertible \(3 \times 3\) matrices. Both of these are under the same operation.</li>
	<li>Non-example: \(\mathbf{Z}_n\): congruence classes modulo \(n\) with addition. We also have \(\phi(n)\): congruence classes with multiplicative inverses. This has the operation multiplication so it's not a subgroup! Even when you define \(\phi(4) = \{[1],[3]\}\) with addition, it will not satisfy the group requirements, so it's not a subgroup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we need to check a lot for subgroups. We have a set of necessary conditions.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
The necessary conditions for a subset \(H\) of \(G\) to be a subgroup of \(G\) are:
<ol>
	<li>\(H\) is not empty</li>
	<li>\(H\) is closed under multiplication. That is, for all elements \(h_1\) and \(h_2\) of \(H\), the products \(h_1h_2\) is also an element of \(H\)</li>
	<li>\(H\) is closed under inverses. For all \(h \in H\), the inverse \(h^{-1}\) is an element of \(H\)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br /></p>
<ul>
	<li>\(H\) is associative. For any \(a,b,c \in H\), \((ab)c = a(bc)\). We're inheriting the same operation from \(G\) so \(H\) must be associative.</li>
	<li>\(H\) has an identity element: We know \(H\) is non-empty by (1). We also know for any \(h \in H\), \(h^{-1} \in H\) by (3). By (2), \(H\) is closed under multiplication so \(hh^{-1} \in H\) but \(hh^{-1} = e\) so the identity element is in \(H\).  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Consider the group \(G = S_4\) permutations of \(\{1,2,3,4\}\). The order of this group is \(|G| = 4\). The following are subgroups of \(S_4\):</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(H=\{ \sigma \in S_4 \ | \ \sigma(4) = 4\}\). So this subgroup fixes \(4\) in the permutation. \(|H| = 3! = 6\). In fact, it is permuting only 3 numbers and it is isomorphic to \(S_3\).</li>
	<li>\(H'=\{e,(1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4), (1 \ 4)(2 \ 3)\}\). It's not empty. It has the identity element. Every element is its own inverse. The one thing not too obvious is proving it is closed. This subgroup is isomorphic to the symmetry group of the rectangle.</li>
	<li>\(H''=\{e,(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4)(4 \ 3 \ 2 \ 1), (1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4), (1 \ 4)(2 \ 3), (1 \ 3),(2 \ 4)\}\). This one is isomorphic to \(D_4\) which is the symmetries of the square.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>

<p><br />

<h4><b>Generated Subgroups</b></h4>
<p>Before talking about subgroups we need the following lemma
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Lemma (Book Proposition 2.2.8)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(H_1, H_2,...,H_n\) be subgroups of \(G\). Then 
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	H = H_1 \cap H_2 \ \cap ... \cap \ H_n
	\end{align*}
	$$
is a subgroup of \(G\). More generally, if \(\{H_{\alpha}\}\) is any collection of subgroups, then \(\cap_{\alpha}\) is a subgroup.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
</div>
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
The intersection must have the identity element. The intersection is closed under the operation because for any two elements \(a, b \in H\), their product \(ab \in H\) and since \(a, b\) is in the intersection, then they are in every \(H_i\) group. Same argument for the inverse. 
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(S\) be a subset of \(G\). Then
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \langle S \rangle = \bigcap_{\text{all } H_i \leq G \text{ such that } S \subseteq H_i}
	\end{align*}
	$$
<ul>
<li>\(\langle S \rangle\) is the intersection of all subgroups such that \(S\) is a subset of each subgroup \(H_i\).</li>
<li>\(\langle S \rangle\) is called <b>the subgroup generated by</b> \(S\) and it is the smallest subgroup in \(G\) that contains \(S\).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><br />
<br />
It is the smallest group because by definition for any \(H \leq G\), we have \(S \subseteq H\). So \(\langle S \rangle \subseteq H\) for any \(H\). Additionally from the book we have</p>
<ul>
<li>If \(S\) contains a single element, \(S = \{a\}\), then the subgroup generated by \(S\) is denoted by \(\langle a \rangle\). </li>
<li>If \(G = \langle S \rangle\), then \(G\) is generated by \(S\) or \(S\) generates \(G\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way to describe \(\langle S \rangle\) is take a bottom up approach to describe the elements.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Suppose \(G\) is a group and \(S\) is a subset of \(G\). Then
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \langle S \rangle = \{e\} \cup \{g_1g_2...g_k\} \ | \ k \geq 1, \forall i,..,k \ g_i \in S \text{ or } g_i^{-1} \in S
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><br />
<br />
In other words, \(\langle S \rangle\) is that it contains all the possible products \(g_1g_2...g_n\) where \(g_i \in S\) or \(g_i^{-1} \in S\). The set that contains these words \(\{e\} \cup \{g_1g_2...g_k\}\) is often called the “set of words in \(S\)” in group theory.
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Let \(T\) be the set of words. We need to check that</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(S \subseteq T\). [This is true because all the words of length 1 make up the set \(S\).]</li>
	<li>\(T\) is a subgroup of \(G\). [This is true because \(T\) has the identity element. For any two word, the product of these is just a longer word which is also in \(T\). It is closed under the inverses because \((g_1g_2...g_k) = g_k^{-1}...g_1^{-1}\).]</li>
	<li>If \(H \leq G\) and \(S \subseteq H\), then \(T \subseteq H\). [This is true because if \(H\) contains \(S\) then it must contain all the inverses of these words and then also the products of all of these words since it's group (closed) so it has all of these elements and it contains \(T\).]</li>
</ul>
<p>These three conditions imply that \(T = \langle S \rangle\). We’ll use this proposition a lot. 
<br />
<br />
Some Examples</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(\langle (1 \ 2) \rangle = \{e, (1 \ 2)\}\). This says that the subgroup generated by \(\{(1 \ 2)\}\) is \(\{e, (1 \ 2)\} = \langle (1 \ 2) \rangle \)</li>
	<li>\(\langle (1 \ 2 \ 3) \rangle = \{e, (1 \ 2 \ 3), (1 \ 3 \ 2)\}\)</li>
	<li>\(S_3 = \langle (1 \ 2), (1 \ 2 \ 3) \rangle\).</li>
	<li>\(S_4 = \langle (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4), (2 \ 4) \rangle\). </li>	
</ul>

<h4><b>Cyclic Groups and Cyclic Subgroups</b></h4>
<p>We’ll start with the definition
<br /></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
A group \(G\) is cyclic if \(G = \langle a \rangle\) for some \(a \in G\). Similarly, a subgroup \(H \leq G\) is cyclic if \(H = \langle a \rangle\) for some \(a \in G\). 
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<br />
In fact, we can describe all the elements in a cyclic subgroup as follows
<br />
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition (Book 2.2.9)
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(a\) be an element of a group \(G\). The subgroup \(\langle a \rangle\) generated by \(a\) is \(\{a^k \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}\).
</div>
<p><br />
Note here that this subgroup is abelian!
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br />
<b>Proof (book)</b>
<br />
Let \(H = \{a^k \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}\). We will show that \(\langle a \rangle = H\) as follows:
<br />
<br />
\(\langle a \rangle \subseteq H\): We know that \(G\) is a group and \(H\) is subset of \(G\). We claim that it is a subgroup of \(G\). It is closed under multiplication because for any \(a^k\) and \(a^l\) in \(H\), \(a^{k+l} \in H\). It is closed under inverses because for any \(a^k \in H\), \((a^{k})^{-1} = a^{-k} \in H\). Furthermore, \(H\) contains \(a\) and since \(H\) is a subgroup, then \(H\) contains all the powers of \(a\). Therefore, \(\langle a \rangle \subseteq H\). 
<br />
<br />
\(H \subseteq \langle a \rangle\): We showed that \(H = \{a^k \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}\) is a subgroup above. It is closed under multiplication and so it contains all powers of \(a\). Therefore, \(H \subseteq \langle a \rangle\). \(\ \blacksquare\) 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Suppose \(G = (\mathbf{Z}, + )\). For any element \(a \in \mathbf{Z}\),</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \langle a \rangle = \{ka \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\} = \mathbf{Z}a.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<ul>
<li>The set of powers of \(a\) is the set of all multiples of \(a\) since the group operation is addition. So \(a+a+a+a+a\) is the fifth power.</li>

<li>If \(a = 0\), then \(\langle a \rangle = \mathbf{Z}0 = \{0\}\)  is the trivial subgroup. </li>

<li>If \(a = 0\), then \(\mathbf{Z}a\) is infinite. In fact it is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}\) so \(\mathbf{Z}a \approx \mathbf{Z}\). </li>

<li>Note here that \(\mathbf{Z} \neq \mathbf{Z}a\) unless \(a = \pm 1\).</li>

<li>Also note, that \(\langle a \rangle  = \langle -a \rangle\).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now consider \(a, b \in \mathbf{Z}\). Suppose we want to find the subgroup generated by the set of \(\{a,b\}\), In other words, \(\langle a,b \rangle\). This is the set of all words composed of \(a\) and \(b\) and their inverses. In fact is the set of all integer combinations of \(a\) and \(b\)</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \langle a, b \rangle = \{ma + nb \ : \ m,n \in \mathbf{Z}\} = I(a,b)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is also a cyclic subgroup because \(\langle a, b \rangle = I(a,b) = \mathbf{Z}d\) where \(d = gcd(a,b)\) So the gcd is the generator of this subgroup. In fact, we will see next that all subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}\) are cyclic
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Cyclic Subgroups in \(\mathbf{Z}\)</b></h4>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
<ol>
	<li>All subgroups of \((\mathbf{Z}, +)\) are cyclic except for the trivial subgroup \(\langle 0 \rangle = \{0\}\). </li>
	<li>All subgroups are infinite.</li>
	<li>Each subgroup is generated by  a unique \(d \geq 0\).</li>
	<li>Each non-trivial subgroup is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}\).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof (1)</b>
<br />
To prove that all subgroups are cyclic, we need to find a generator for each of the subgroups. We have two cases:
<br />
If \(H = \{0\}\), then \(H = \mathbf{Z}0\) and we are done.
<br />
If \(H \neq \{0\}\), then \(H\) has at least a non-zero element. By the well ordering principle of \(\mathbf{N}\), there is a smallest element \(d \in H \cap \mathbf{N}\) (\(d\) is the smallest positive element in \(H\)). We claim that \(H = \mathbf{Z}d\). 
<br />
<br />
\(\mathbf{Z}d \subseteq H\): We know \(d \in H\) and \(H\) is a group. Therefore, any multiple of \(d\) is in \(H\) since it must be closed so \(\mathbf{Z}d \subseteq H\) as required.
<br />
<br />
\(H \subseteq \mathbf{Z}d\): Suppose \(x \in H\). We want to show that \(x\) is a multiple of \(d\). Use division with remainder (\(x \div d\)) to get \(x = qd + r\) such that \(q, r \in \mathbf{Z}\) and \(0 \leq r &lt; d\). Observe now that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	r = x - qd.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(x \in H\) by assumption. \(qd \in H\) since \(d \in H\). Therefore, we must have \(r \in H\). But \(d\) is the smallest positive element in \(H\) by the hypothesis and \(r &lt; d\) so \(r\) must be zero. Therefore, \(x = qd \in \mathbf{Z}d\) and \(H = \mathbf{Z}d\) as we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Lattice of subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}\)</b></h4>
<p>We can organize all the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}\) in a lattice ordered by the subset relation. For example the all the multiples of 4 are contained in the multiples of 2, so \(\mathbf{Z}4 \subset \mathbf{Z}4\) and it it goes under \(\mathbf{Z}2\) and so. This lattice is also a divisibility lattice meaning that if \(\mathbf{Z}a \subseteq \mathbf{Z}b\), then \(b \ | \ a\). For example we see that \(\mathbf{Z}6 \subset \mathbf{Z}3\) in the lattice and so this implies that \(3 \ | \ 6\).</p>

<h4><b>Order of an Element</b></h4>
<p>Suppose \(G\) is a group and \(a \in G\), then we denote the order of an element by \(o(a)\). The order of \(a\) is as follows
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
\(o(a) = |\langle a \rangle| \in \mathbf{N} \cap \{\infty\} \)
</div>
<p><br />
Alternatively
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition (Book: 2.2.17)
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
	<ul>
<li>If \(o(a) = n\), then \(n\) is the least positive integer such that \(a^n = e\). Furthermore, \(\langle a \rangle = \{a^k \ : \ 0 \leq k &lt; o(a)\}\).</li>
<li>If \(o(a) = \infty\), then \(a^n \neq e \ \forall n\).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
These two are equivalent.
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
By definition, the cyclic subgroup generated by \(a\) is \(\langle a \rangle = \{a^k \ | \ k \in \mathbf{Z} \}\). If \(\langle a \rangle\) is finite, then two powers of \(a\) must coincide (side note: why? think of the integers mod 7 with addition, \(2^2 = 2+2\) and \(2^9=18\) both leave a remainder of 4. While \(2^7\) is \(e\)). So \(a^i = a^{j}\) for some \(i &lt; j\). This means that \(a^{j-i} = e\) where \(k = j - i &gt; 0\). Therefore, let \(k\) be the smallest positive number such that \(a^k = e\). We claim that \(k = n\). To see this, suppose we have some power \(m\) of \(a\). Write \(m = kq + r\) where \(0 \leq r &lt; k\) and \(r = rem_k(m)\). This means that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \langle a \rangle = \{e, a, a^2, ..., a^{k-1}\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Since \(n\) is the size of the set by assumption, then \(n \leq k\). But that means that that we have two powers in the set above that must coincide where \(a\) raised to the power of their difference is the identity element. But this is a contradiction since we said that \(k\) is the smallest positive number such that \(a^k = e\). Therefore, we must have \(n = k\). So the minimality of \(k\) implies their equality. 
<br />
<br />
If \(\langle a \rangle\) is infinite, we can use the same argument to show that if \(a^k = e\) for some \(k &gt; 0\), then all elements can be written as \(\langle a \rangle = \{e, a, a^2, ..., a^{k-1}\}\) but this is a finite set which is a contradiction. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
The notion of order leads to the following result
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition (Book 2.2.20)
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(a\) be an element of a group \(G\).
<ol type="a">
	<li>If \(a\) has infinte order, then \(\langle a \rangle\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}\)</li>
	<li>If \(a\) has finite order, then \(\langle a \rangle\) is isomorphic to the group \(\mathbf{Z}_n\)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof (book)</b>
<br />
For \((a)\), we want to show this by finding an example of an isomorphism. So define the map</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \varphi \ : \ &amp;\mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \langle a \rangle \\
	 &amp;\varphi(k) = a^k.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To show that this map is an isomorphism, we need to show that it is a bijection and also that for any two elements \(a, b \in \mathbf{Z}\), \(\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\) (Definition 2.1.13).
<br />
<br />
To show that it is a bijection, observe that this map is surjective or onto by the definition of \(\langle a \rangle\). (Recall that that \(\langle a \rangle\) is of infinite order). It is also injective or 1-1 because all the elements of \(\langle a \rangle\) (powers of \(a\)) are distinct. Furthermore, see that \(\varphi(k + l) = a^{k+l} = a^ka^k\). So \(\varphi\) is an isomorphism.
<br />
<br />
Similarly for \((b)\), we want to define an isomorphism. Note here that both \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) and \(\langle a \rangle\) have \(n\) elements so define the map</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \varphi \ : \ &amp;\mathbf{Z}_n \rightarrow \langle a \rangle \\ 
	 &amp;\varphi([k]) = a^k.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>where \(0 \leq k \leq n-1\). In \(\mathbf{Z}_n\), the addition of \([k]\) and \([l]\) is \([r]\) where \(r\) is the remainder after dividing \(k+l\) by \(n\). While the multiplication in \(\langle a \rangle\) is given by \(a^ka^l = a^{k+l} = a^r\) where \(r\) is also the remainder after dividing \(k+l\) by \(n\) as we saw earlier. Therefore \(\varphi\) is an isomorphism.

\((2)\) simply says that the standard representative/generator of the cyclic subgroup \(\langle a \rangle\) is \(gcd(a, n)\). We can replace \(a\) with \(gcd(a,n)\). They both represent the same congruence class.<br /> \((3)\) is similar to \(\mathbf{Z}\). Recall that \(\mathbf{Z}2\) (multiples of 2) contains the subgroup \(\mathbf{Z}4\) and we concluded that \(\mathbf{Z}4 \subseteq \mathbf{Z}2\) implies that \(2 \ | \ 4\). A similar thing here.
<br />
<br />
To prove this theorem we need the following lemma:
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Lemma
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Given a subset \(H \subseteq \mathbf{Z}_n\). Define
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\tilde{H} &amp;= \{a \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ [a]_n \in H \} \subseteq \mathbf{Z} \\
	          &amp;= \bigcup_{S \in H} S
 	\end{align*}
	$$
Then, \(H\) is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) if and only if \(\tilde{H}\) is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}\).
</div>
<p><br />
So \(H\) is a set of integers such that the elements are the representatives of the congruence classes in \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). The proof of this lemma is in the lecture notes.
<br />
<br />
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Theorem Proof</b>
<br />
For (1), Let \(H \leq \mathbf{Z}_n\) be a subgroup. We want to show that \(H\) is cyclic by proving that \(H\) is a cyclic group generated by some element. Consider \(\tilde{H}\). Since \(H\) is a subgroup, then \(\tilde{H}\) is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) by the lemma. Moreover, \(\tilde{H} = \mathbf{Z}d\) for some \(d \in \mathbf{Z}\) by the previous theorem (every subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}\) is cyclic and is generated by some \(d\)). Therefore, by the definition of \(\tilde{H}\), \([d]\) must be a congruence class in \(H\). This implies that \(\langle [d] \rangle \subseteq H\) since \(H\) is a group and all multiples of \(d\) must be in \(H\). 
<br />
<br />
To prove the other direction \(H \subseteq \langle [d] \rangle\), consider \([a] \in H\). This means that \(a \in \tilde{H}\) by the definition of \(\tilde{H}\). But \(\tilde{H} = \mathbf{Z}d\) so \(a\) is a multiple of \(d\) and we can write \(a = sd\) for some \(s \in \mathbf{Z}\). Therefore, \([a] = s[d]\) and \([a] \in \langle [d] \rangle\). Therefore, \(H = \langle d \rangle\) and \(H\) is cyclic as we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
For (2), suppose that \(d = gcd(a,n)\). We want to show that \(\langle [a] \rangle = \langle [d] \rangle\). Since \(d\) is the gcd, then \(d\) divides both \(a\) and \(n\). Also \(d = I(a,n)\) and we can write \(d = sa + tn\) for some \(s, t \in \mathbf{Z}\). 
<br />
<br />
Since \(a \ | \ d\), then \(a = sd\) and so \([a] = s[d]\) so \(\langle [a] \rangle \subseteq \langle [d] \rangle\). Since \(d = sa + tn\), then \([d] = s[d] + t[n] = s[d]\) because \([n] = [0]\) since we’re in \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). Therefore, \(\langle [d] \rangle \subseteq \langle [a] \rangle\). So we’ve shown that \(\langle [a] \rangle = \langle [d] \rangle\) as we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />

<h4><b>Subgroups of Finite Cyclic Groups</b></h4>
<p>In fact, not just the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) that are cyclic. All subgroups of any finite cyclic group \(G\) are cyclic. We can generalize the previous theorem as follows
