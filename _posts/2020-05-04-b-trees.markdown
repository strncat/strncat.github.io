B-trees are balanced search trees. While red-black trees are also balanced search trees, their branching factor is only 2. B-trees differ in that their branching factor can be really large. The number of keys in a B-tree node determines the number of its children. A node with $$n$$ keys have $$n+1$$ children. This way, each child handles a specific range of keys in its parent.

<h4><b>Motivation</b></h4>
But why do we need a large branching factor? The motivation behind this idea has to do with minimizing disk I/O operations. Data off disk can be read in <i>pages</i>, so to minimize the number of reads,
