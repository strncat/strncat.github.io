<p>From wikipedia, “One radian is defined as the angle subtended from the center of a circle which intercepts an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle”. Some additional facts:</p>
<ul>
<li> The ratio of the circumference ($c$) to the diameter ($d$) of the circle (any circle) is the constant $\pi$. </li>
	<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\pi = \frac{c}{d} = \frac{c}{2r}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
    </div>

<li> This means that the circumference is given by, </li>
	\begin{align}
	c = 2\pi r.
	\end{align}

<li> Since the circumference is $2\pi r$, then there are $2\pi r / r = 2\pi$ such arcs of length $r$ in any circle each. This is about 6.28 arcs! (see below)</li>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/arcs.png" width="55%" class="center" /></p>
	


<li> So, we have $2\pi$ arcs of length $r$ that cover the whole circle. Each of their angles is measured at 1 radian. This means that to go a whole rotation around the entire circle we need $2\pi * 1 = 2\pi$ radians. </li>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/2pi.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>



<li> So, a 360 degrees measure is equal to $2\pi$ radians or in other words, 1 radian is equal to 57.2958 degrees and that's where the conversion formula between degrees and radians come from. </li>
</ul>

Let the given point be $A$ and the given finite line be $CB$.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr2/1.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Use postule 1 to draw a line between $A$ and one of the end points say $B$.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr2/2.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Next, use <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/23/euclid-pr1.html">proposition 1</a> to draw an equilateral triangle from the drawn line $AB$.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr2/3.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Next, describe a circle with center $B$ and radius $CB$ using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/22/euclid-book1-postulates.html">postulate 3</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr2/5.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Extend the line DB all the way till intersects the circle at $E$ using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/22/euclid-book1-postulates.html">postulate 2</a>.</p>

<p>The claim is that $AF = BC$ which is what we want.

<br /></p>
<hr />

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof.</b><br />
Let the greater line be $AB$ and the smaller line be $CD$.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr3/1.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>

We also know that $EA = AF$ by construction.

<h4><b>Bezier Curves</b></h4>
<p>From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds"> The Continuity of Splines</a>, I learned that starting with two points $p_0$ and $p_1$ we can create a path between them by linearly interpolating between the two points using</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/curves/00-line.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
P(t) = (1-t)P_0 + tP_1
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>where $t$ is a value between 0 and 1. So for $t=0$, we get $P_0$ and for $t=1$, we get $P_1$. For any other $t$ value, we get a point on the line between the two end points. So now that we have this, we can add a second point and also interpolate between the second and third point using the same $t$ in</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/curves/01-secondline.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
P'(t) = (1-t)P_1 + tP_2
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>And now interpolate between the brand new two points $(1-t)P_0 + tP_1$ and (1-t)P_1 + tP_2.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/curves/01-secondline.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
P(t) &amp;= (1-t)((1-t)P_0 + tP_1) + t((1-t)P_1 + tP_2) \\
&amp;= (1-t)^2P_0 + 2(1-t)tP_1 + t^2P_2
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This is called a quadractic Bezier curve and it generates a nice smooth curve!
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Cubic Bezier Curve</b></h4>
<p>We don’t have to stop at the quadratic Bezier curve. Let’s add a third point and again interpolate between the second and third point</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/curves/01-secondline.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<p>and let’s connect all the new points</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/curves/01-secondline.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<p>and again connect the last two points</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/curves/01-secondline.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<p>The curve generated is a smooth curve and called the cubic Bezier curve! Combining and labeling everything. We have:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a &amp;= (1-t)P_0 + tP_1 \\
b &amp;= (1-t)P_1 + tP_2 \\
c &amp;= (1-t)P_2 + tP_3 \\
d &amp;= (1-t)a + tb \\
e &amp;= (1-t)b + tc \\
P(t) &amp;= (1-t)d + te
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This is known as the DeCasteljau algorithm. There is another form of these points written a weighted sum of the control points themselves,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
P &amp;= P_0(-t^3 + 3t^2 - 3t + 1) \\
 &amp;+  P_1(3t^3 - 6t^2 + 3t)  \\
 &amp;+  P_2(-3t^3 + 3t^2) \\
 &amp;+  P_3(t^3)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This is the Bernstein form of the Bezier curve. This form is so interesting in that at the beginning when $t=0$, It’s just $P_0$ as you move along the weights will get adjusted but they will all add up to 1 at any point until you reach the end when $t=1$ and we’re at 100% of $P_3$. This weighted sum is also called a convex combination.
<br />
<br />
But there is yet another form which re-arranges the points around the $t$ coefficients</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
P &amp;= P_0 \\
 &amp;+  t(-3P_0 + 3P_1)  \\
 &amp;+  t^2 (3P_0 - 6P_1 + 3P_2) \\
 &amp;+  t^3 (-P_0 + 3P_1 - 3P_2 + P_3)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>And finally, the forth form which is the matrix form.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
P &amp;= [1 t t^2 t^3][ 1 0 0 0]
                  [-3 3 0 0]
				  [3 -6 3 0]
				  [-1 3 -3 1]
				  [p_0 p_1 p_2 p_3]
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Bezier Curves of Higher Degrees</b></h4>
<p>We can keep adding more and more control points to form the curve that we want but as we add more points, it gets more expensive to calculate and also harder to manipulate as moving a single control point affects the entire curve. For this reason, instead of adding more degrees, we instead connect these bezier curves together to form a Bezier Spline!

<h4><b>Mesh Representation</b></h4>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/curves/00-line.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<p>We can represent meshes using different ways. One way to represent a mesh is to simply store the triangles the mesh is made up. Another representation is storing the list of vertices and then the list of indexed triangles so for example</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
Vertices: \\
0: x_0, y_0, z_0 \\
1: x_1, y_1, z_1 \\
Triangles: \\
0, 1, 2, \\
0, 1, 3
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Note here that we can have the same set of vertices represent two different mesh topologies. so take this square for example. We can represent it with the two triangles or the other two triangles.</p>

We want to draw on screen the line given by the two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$. To simplify things, we will restrict ourselves to positive slopes that are less than 1 and so $m = \Delta y/\Delta x &lt; 1$. Therefore $\Delta x &gt; \Delta y$. For this reason, we’re going to step in the right direction from $x_1$ to $x_2$ since we have more steps in $x$ than in $y$.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/graphics/bresenham/1.png" width="55%" class="center" /></p>
<p>We’re going to start by the drawing the very first point at $(x,y)=(x_1,y_1)$. Next we’re going to move right to to $x+1$ (We will always move in $x$ in each iteration and so we’ll have two choices for which point to draw. It will either be the point $(x+1,y)$ or the point $(x+1,y+1)$). As we keep moving in the x-direction, we’ll accumulate the error in the y direction in a new variable $\epsilon$.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/graphics/bresenham/errors.png" width="55%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Notice above that if we always draw the point $(x+1,y)$ and never do anything with the y-coordinate, then we’ll draw the shaded yellow points above while our error term will just keep increasing forever. We don’t want that. What should the error term be then? Let’s zoom in at the first case when we draw the point $(x+1,y)$.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/graphics/bresenham/first-case.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Notice here, that $y$ on the line is really the $y$ that we drew plus the error term that we want to keep track of. Moreover, recall that the slope is just $\Delta y/\Delta x$. $\Delta x$ is 1 here since we moved from x to $x+1$. So $m=(y+\epsilon-y)/1=\epsilon$. This means that we can just add $m$ to the error term as move in the right direction! åWe will decide whether to move up to $y+1$ versus stay on $y$ if the error term is greater that 0.5. Suppose now, the error is actually greater than 0.5 and we moved $y$ one step up, how should be adjust the error term?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/graphics/bresenham/second-case.png" width="55%" class="center" /></p>
<p>As before, we first (always) move one step forward in the $x$ direction. We add $m$ to our error term like we explained in the previous paragram. Now the error term is greater than $0.5$. We move in the $y$ direction one step. Notice here that the error term is now decreased by 1 since we moved one step up. So we just drecrement $\epsilon$ by 1. The overall procedure will be:</p>

<h4><b>Integers Only!</b></h4>
<p>The above procedure works really well but we don’t want floats. We want integers only. What can we do to avoid calculating the slope $m$. In every iteration, notice that we’re adding $m$ to $\epsilon$ and then directly comparing it again the threadshold $0.5$. Let’s expand the terms and see where we can go.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\epsilon + m &amp;&lt; 0.5 \\
\epsilon + \Delta y/\Delta x &amp;&lt; 0.5 \\
\Delta x\epsilon + \Delta y &amp;&lt; 0.5\Delta x \\
2\Delta x\epsilon + 2\Delta y &amp;&lt; \Delta x \\
2(\epsilon' + \Delta y) &amp;&lt; \Delta x\\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>where $\epsilon’ = \Delta x\epsilon$ above. So when we first update the error to add $m$ to it. Instead of adding $m$, we will add $\Delta y$. To see why let’s expand the term again.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\epsilon &amp;= \epsilon + m \\
\epsilon &amp;= \epsilon + \Delta y/\Delta \\
\Delta x\epsilon &amp;= \Delta x\epsilon + \Delta y \\
\epsilon' &amp;= \epsilon' + \Delta y
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>And when we decrement 1, we can do the same and expand to see.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\epsilon &amp;= \epsilon - 1 \\
\epsilon' / \Delta x &amp;= \epsilon' \ \Delta x - 1 \\
\epsilon' &amp;= \epsilon' - \Delta x \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Here is the procedure again with the lines changed marked with “CHANGED”.</p>

<h4><b>Generalizing The Algorithm</b></h4>
<p>So far we have code that works for the first octant ONLY! where the slope is positive and is less than 1. How do we handle the other cases? We’re going to handle the case when the $\Delta x$ is still larger in magnitude than $\Delta y$.
<br />
<br /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/graphics/bresenham/fourth-octant.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Let’s start with the fourth octant. Here $|m| &lt; 1$ but $x_1$ is greater than $x_2$. This shouldn’t be too bad right? While we draw we’re going to decrement $x$ in each iteration (instead of incrementing). This can be easily done if we introduce a variable xstep and make it equal to -1 whenever $x_1 &gt; x_2$. Additionally, we will need to flip the sign of $\Delta x$ to be positive again. This way the slope is positive and we can use the same exact code for the first octant.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/graphics/bresenham/eighth-octant.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>
<p>For the fifth octant. This time $\Delta y$ is negative so we want to flip that and also move $y$ down instead of up. So we’ll introduce a variable $ystep$ and set it to -1 whenever $y_1 &gt; y_2$. Notice here that $\Delta x$ is still larger than $\Delta x$. So the same exact code still works!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/graphics/bresenham/fifth-octant.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>
<p>What about the eigth octant? The magnitude of the slope is still between 0 and 1. But now we have both $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ negative. We just need to flip these! along with making $xstep$ and $ystep$ both be -1.
<br />
<br />
Next, we’ll handle all the remaining octants where the magnitude of the slope is greate than 1. Here we have more steps in $y$ than in $x$. So we need instead to move in the $y$ direction while keeping the error term to track the error in $x$ instead of $y$. So the same exact code still but we just need to swap $x$ and $y$! of course we will still need to adjust value of xstep and ystep similar to the above cases that we discussed.
