1.4: Problem 4:

<h3>Proof</h3>
(1) Suppose we have $$2n$$ elements. We want to partition $$S$$ into $$n$$ disjoint sets. There $$(2n)!$$ possible ways to order $$2n$$ elements. But then order of $$n$$ groups doesn't matter so we need to divide by $$n!$$. Furthermore, for any group of elements $$a$$ and $$b$$, $$\{a,b\}=\{b,a\}$$. So we need to divide by 2 for each pair. Since we have $$n$$ pairs, then we need to divide by $$2^n$$. Therefore, the number of ways is
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{(2n)!}{n!2^n}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
Another way to look at this is by fixing an element and then picking its paired element. There are $$2n-1$$ ways to pick which element to pair it with. Next, we fix another element. Now we have $$2n-3$$ elements to pair it with. If we do this for each element we will get
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
(2n -1) \cdot (2n - 3) \cdot 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 1
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
(2) We first recognize that this product is precisely
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{(2n)!}{n!} = (n+1)(n+2) \cdots (2n)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
Then, this becomes a question of counting the number of times $$2$$ divides this fraction and if it at least $$n$$ which means that $$2^n$$ can divide it. By lecture, to know the number of times a prime (in this case 2) divides $$\frac{(2n)!}{n!}$$ is
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
&\floor{\frac{2n}{2}} + \floor{\frac{2n}{2^2}} + \floor{\frac{2n}{2^3}} + \cdots \\
- &\floor{\frac{n}{2}} - \floor{\frac{n}{2^2}} - \floor{\frac{n}{2^3}} - \cdots \\
&= \sum_k^{\infty} \floor{\frac{2n}{2^k}} - \floor{\frac{n}{2^k}}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
But now notice that all the middle fractions do cancel except for the first and very last. The very last fraction is 0. Therefore,
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\sum_k^{\infty} \floor{\frac{2n}{2^k}} - \floor{\frac{n}{2^k}} = \floor{\frac{2n}{2^0}} = n
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
From this we see that we have exactly $$n$$ 2's so 2^$$n$$ is divisble by $$\frac{(2n)!}{n!}$$ but not $$\frac{(2n)!}{n!}$$
