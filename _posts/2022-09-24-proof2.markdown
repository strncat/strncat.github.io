<b>Proposition</b>: If two integers have opposite parity, then their sum is odd.
<br>

<br>
<b>Proof.</b><br>
Suppose $m$ and $n$ are two integers with opposite parity. We will show that their sum is odd. 
Without the loss of generality, suppose $m$ is even and $n$ is odd. Therefore, $m = 2k$ for some $k \in Z$ and $n = 2l+1$ for some $l \in Z$. Therefore, $m + n = 2k + 2l + 1 = 2(k + l) + 1$ which is odd by definition. $\blacksquare$
