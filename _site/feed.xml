<b>Proposition 6</b>: “If in a triangle two angles be equal to one another, the sides which subtend the equal angles will also be equal to one another.”
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof.</b><br /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr6/0.png" width="45%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Let the triangle be $ABC$. Choose two angles to be equal. Suppose we let $\angle B = \angle C$. We will prove that $AB = AC$. Suppose they are not. This means that one of them is greater than the other. Choose one arbitrarly to be the greater one. Suppose it is $AB$. Use <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/23/euclid-book1-pr3.html">proposition 3</a> to cut a line from $AB$ equal to $AC$. Let the cut line be $DB$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr6/1.png" width="45%" class="center" /></p>

<p>In the triangles $ABC$ and $DBC$, first $DB = AC$ by construction. Second, $BC$ is a common base. Third, $\angle DBC$ is a common angle. From this we can conclude that the triangles are equal in all respects by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/23/euclid-book1-pr4.html">proposition 4</a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr6/2.png" width="75%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Consquently, w$\angle ACB = \angle DCB$ let this angle be $\alpha$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr6/3.png" width="75%" class="center" /></p>

<p>But angle $\angle ACB$ equals to the sum of angles $\angle ACD$ and $\angle DCB$. Since $\angle ACB = \angle DCB = \alpha$, this implies that $\angle ACD$ must be 0, but this is impossible because this means that the vertices $A$ and $D$ are the same and we assumed that $AB$ is greater. So $AB$ must be equal to $AC$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/unit-circle-point-0.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>

<p>We’re interested in the 5th part since we want $\frac{5\pi}{6}$. The point corresponding to the angle $\frac{5\pi}{6}$ has the same y-coordinate of the point corresponding to $\frac{\pi}{6}$. It also has the same magnitude of the x-coordinate but the sign is negative.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/unit-circle-point-1.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>

<p>The coordinates of the point at angle $\frac{\pi}{6}$ are $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ and so the coordinates of the point at $\frac{5\pi}{6}$ will be $(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$.</p>

<b>Proposition 5</b>: “In isosceles triangles the angles at the base are equal to one another, and, if the equal straight lines be produced further, the angles under the base will be equal to one another.”
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Construction.</b><br />
Let $ABC$ be a triangle with two equal sides. Let the equal sides be $AB$ and $AC$. This triangle can be easily constructed by drawing a point and then describing a circle with the center at the given point and a radius of a given length using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/20/euclid-book1-postulates.html">postulate 3</a>. We can then draw two lines from the center to the edge of the circle. These lines are equal by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/19/euclid-book1-definitions.html">definition 15</a>. Furthermore we can draw a third line connecting the two intersection points to form an isosceles triangle using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/20/euclid-book1-postulates.html">postulate 1</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/0.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/20/euclid-book1-postulates.html">postulate 2</a>, we can extend the lines $AB$ and $AC$ further down. The claim is that the orange and yellow angles below must be equal.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/1.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Define some point arbitrarly chosen along the exteneded line that we drew from point $B$. Let this point be $E$. Using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/23/euclid-book1-pr2.html">proposition 2</a>, we can define point $D$ on the other side such that $BE = CD$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/2.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/20/euclid-book1-postulates.html">postulate 1</a>, connect the lines between the points $C$ and $E$ and then again between the points $B$ and $D$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/3.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>

<p><b>Proof.</b><br />
In the shaded triangles $AEC$ and $ADB$, first, the triangles share an angle $A$. Second, $AC = AB$ by construction. Third, $AE = AD$. This is because $AB = AC$ and $BE = CD$ (both by construction). Therefore $AB + BE = AC + CD$ and so $AE = AD$ by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/21/euclid-book1-common-notions.html">common notion 2</a> (if equals are added to equal parts, then the wholes are equal). Since we have one angle and the two sides connecting it all equal then we can conclude that by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/23/euclid-book1-pr4.html">proposition 4</a>, the triangles are equal.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/4.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Consequently, the highlighted angles below are equal. Namely $\angle ACE = \angle ABD = \alpha$ and $\angle AEC = \angle ADB$. Furthermore, the blue lines are also equal, namely $BD = CE$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/5.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Next, consider the triangles $BEC$ and $BCD$ below. We claim that the triangles are also equal. To see this, we know that angles $\angle AEC = \angle ADB$ are equal (previously proven above). We also know that the sides $BD$ and $CE$ are also equal. lastly, $CD = $BE$ by construction. Therefore, these triangles are also equal in all respects by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/23/euclid-book1-pr4.html">proposition 4</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/6.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Consquently, the highlighted angles will be equal, $\angle BCE = \angle CBD = \beta$ and $\angle EBC = \angle BCD = \gamma$.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr5/7.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>So far we’ve proven $\angle ACE = \angle ABD = \alpha$ and $\angle BCE = \angle CBD = \beta$.  Therefore, the internal angles $ACB$ and $ABD$ are equal due to <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/21/euclid-book1-common-notions.html">common notion 3</a> (If equals be taken away from equals the remainders will be equal). Furthermore, we also proved that $\angle EBC = \angle BCD = \gamma$. Therefore the external angles are also equal by using <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/21/euclid-book1-common-notions.html">common notion 2</a> (If equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal).</p>

<p>From wikipedia, “One radian is defined as the angle subtended from the center of a circle which intercepts an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle”. Some additional facts:</p>
<ul>
<li> The ratio of the circumference ($c$) to the diameter ($d$) of the circle (any circle) is the constant $\pi$. </li>
	<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\pi = \frac{c}{d} = \frac{c}{2r}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
    </div>

<li> This means that the circumference is given by, </li>
	\begin{align}
	c = 2\pi r.
	\end{align}

<li> Since the circumference is $2\pi r$, then there are $2\pi r / r = 2\pi$ such arcs of length $r$ in any circle each. This is about 6.28 arcs! (see below)</li>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/arcs.png" width="55%" class="center" /></p>
	


<li> So, we have $2\pi$ arcs of length $r$ that cover the whole circle. Each of their angles is measured at 1 radian. This means that to go a whole rotation around the entire circle we need $2\pi * 1 = 2\pi$ radians. </li>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/trig/2pi.png" width="50%" class="center" /></p>



<li> So, a 360 degrees measure is equal to $2\pi$ radians or in other words, 1 radian is equal to 57.2958 degrees and that's where the conversion formula between degrees and radians come from. </li>

Axiom 10 doesn’t seem to exist in the original book
<br />
<br />
<b>Proposition 4</b>: Proposition 4: “IF two triangles have two sides of the one respectively equal to two sides of the other, and the angles contained by those equal sides also equal; then their bases or their sides  are also equal: and the remaining and their remaining angles opposite to equal sides are respectively equal: and the triangles are equal in every respect.”
<br />
Basically, given two triangles where two of the sides are equal and the angles contained between the two sides in each triangle are also equal, then the two triangles are equal in every other respect meaning that the third side is also equal and the remaining two angles are equal as well.
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof.</b><br />
Let the triangles be $ABC$ and $DEF$. Let the two sides be arbitrarily chosen. Suppose we have $AB = DE$ and $BC = EF$ and the angle $ABC = DEF$ (hypothesis).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/euclid/pr4/1.png" width="60%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Now, place the vertex $A$ onto the vertex $D$. First, because the angles are equal, the line $AB$ will fall onto the line $DE$ (same direction) and second, because we know that $AB = DE$, then the vertex $B$ must coincide with the vertex $E$. Similarly, the vertex $C$ must coincide with the vertex $F$. 
<br /><br />
Since the vertices $B$ and $E$ coincide with each other and the vertices $C$ and $F$ coincide with each other, then the side $BC = EF$. If that’s not the case, then the straight lines connecting $E$ and $F$ and $B$ and $C$ will include a space but axiom 10 states that two straight lines cannot include a space. In other words, there is only one straight line between two points and therefore $BC = EF$.
<br /><br />
So now that we have all vertices coinciding with each other and all three sides coinciding with each other we can conclude that the two triangles coincide with each other and so they are equal in all respects due to axiom 8 (magnitudes which coincide with one another or exactly fill the same space, are equal). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Thoughts:</b>
<br />
(1) When we placed $A$ onto $D$, we concluded two things. First, because the angles are equal, the line $AB$ will fall onto the line $DE$. Second, because it’s given than $AB = DE$, then $A$ must coincide with $D$. I hard to wrap my head around this for a little longer.
<br /><br />
(2) Instead of proving that the third side must be equal to the same third side of the second triangle, I think we could just conclude that the triangles are equal just from having the three vertices coinciding. This is because between any two points, we can only have one straight line (axiom 10) and so the two triangles must coincide and be equal to each other without having to prove the third side seperately. (I think?)
<br /><br />
Overall, this was a confusing proposition. What does placing a vertex on top another vertex even mean? I guess perhaps we could use proposition 2 to re-create the second triangle on top of the first triangle?

<p>The claim is that $AF = BC$ which is what we want. To see this, we know that $DF=DE$ by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/19/euclid-book1-definitions.html">definition 15</a>. We know that $DA = DB$ by construction. Therefore, $BE = AF$ by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/03/21/euclid-book1-common-notions.html">common notion 3</a>. But $CB = BE$ by definition 15 and so $CB = AF$ (common notion 3) as required.

In other words, given a point $A$ and another finite straight line $CB$, draw a line equal to $CB$ at $A$. Proof. Let the given point be $A$ and the given finite line be $CB$. Use postule 1 to draw a line between $A$ and one of the end points say $B$. Next, use proposition 1 to draw an equilateral triangle from the drawn line $AB$. Next, describe a circle with center $B$ and radius $CB$ using postulate 3 Extend the line DB all the way till intersects the circle at $E$ using postulate 2. Now describe another circle with center $D$ and radius $DE$ (postulate 3). Extend the line DA until it intersects the circle at $F$. The claim is that $AF = BC$ which is what we want. To see this, we know that $DF=DE$ by definition 15. We know that $DA = DB$ by construction. Therefore, $BE = AF$ by common notion 3. But $CB = BE$ by definition 15 and so $CB = AF$ (common notion 3) as required.
