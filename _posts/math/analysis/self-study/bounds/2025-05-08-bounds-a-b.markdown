<div class="stmt">
Let \(A\) and \(B\) be nonempty subsets of \(\mathbb{R}\) with \(A\) bounded above and \(B\) bounded below. Define \(A - B = \{a - b: a \in A, b \in B\}\). Prove that \(\sup(A - B) = \sup A - \inf B\)
</div>
<h3>Proof</h3>
Since $$A$$ is bounded above, then by the axiom of completeness we must have a least upper bound, $$\sup A$$. Similarly, since $$B$$ is bounded below, then we must have a greatest lower bound, $$\inf B$$. Now, for any $$a$$, we must have
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a \leq \sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
Let $$b$$ be any element in $$B$$. Subtract $$b$$ from each side to see that
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a - b &\leq \sup A - b \\
      &\leq \sup A - \inf B \quad \text{(because $b \geq \inf B$)}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
This establishes $$\sup A - \inf B$$ as an upper bound for $$A - B$$. Next, we want to show that $$\sup A - \inf B$$ is the least upper bound. This means that want to show for all $$\epsilon > 0$$, that there exists some element $$a - b \in A - B$$ such that 
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a - b \geq \sup A - \inf B - \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
Since $$\sup A$$ is the least upper bound, then we know that for any $$\epsilon > 0$$, there exists some element $$a$$ such that
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a &> \sup A - \frac{\epsilon}{2}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
Similarly 
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
b &< \inf B + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \\
-b &> - \inf B - \frac{\epsilon}{2} 
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
Adding both inequalities
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a - b &> \left(\sup A - \frac{\epsilon}{2}\right) + \left(-\inf B - \frac{\epsilon}{2}\right) \\
a - b &> \sup A - \inf B - \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
As we wanted to show. $$\ \blacksquare$$
