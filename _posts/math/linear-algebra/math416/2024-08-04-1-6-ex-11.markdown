1.6 Exercise 11
</div>
<div class="ybdiv">
Let \(u\) and \(v\) be distinct vectors of a vector space \(V\). Show that if \(\{u, v\}\) is basis for \(V\), and \(a\) and \(b\) are non-zero scalars, then both \(\{u+v, au\}\) and \(\{au, bv\}\) are also bases for \(V\).
</div>
<br>
Proof: 
<br>
To prove that $$\{u+v, au\}$$ is basis, we need to show that the set of vectors are linearly independent and that $$span(\{u+v, au\}) = V$$. Let $$a_1, a_2$$ be any two scalars. Then we want to prove that the following equation
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	a_1(u+v) + a_2(au) = \bar{0}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
is only satisfied by the trivial solution. We'll re-arrange the terms as follows,
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\bar{0} &= a_1u + a_1v + aa_2u  \\
	&= (a_1 + aa_2)u + a_1v \\
	&= (a_1 + aa_2)u + a_1v.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
From this, we can see that the only solution is the trivial solution since $$\{u,v\}$$ are linearly independent. Moreover, since $$\{u,v\}$$ is a basis, then its dimension is 2. Therefore, $$\{u+v, au\}$$ is a basis.
<br>
<br>
Similarly, to see that $$\{au, bv\}$$, we'll prove the following equation's solution is the trivial solution only by re-arranging the terms,
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\bar{0} &= a_1(au) + a_2(bv) \\
	\bar{0} &= (a_1a)u + (a_2b)v.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
This is again a linear combination of two linearly independent vectors and so the trivial solution is the only possible solution to this equation. Since the set has 2 vectors, then it's a basis as well. $$\blacksquare$$
