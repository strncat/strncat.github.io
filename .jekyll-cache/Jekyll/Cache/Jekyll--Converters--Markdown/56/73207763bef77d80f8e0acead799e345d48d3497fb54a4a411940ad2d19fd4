<h4><b>Convexity</b></h4>
<p>A set of points $S$ is convex if for any two points $a \in S$ and $b \in S$, then the line segment connecting these two points is also in $S$ ($\overline{ab} subseteq \in S$). A convex polygon is a polygon that is the boundary of a convex set. The left figure is a convex polygon while the right figure is not per our definition.

<h4><b>Convex Hull</b></h4>
<p>The convex hull of $S={p_1,p_2,â€¦,p_n}$ as the set that contains all the combinations of the points in the $S$</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
conv(S) = \{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i p_i | \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i = 1 \text{ and } \lambda_i \geq 0 \text{ for all $i$} \}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We can also define the convex hull of $S$ to be the smallest convex set that contains all the points in $S$ which also implies the definition that the convex hull of $S$ is the intersection of all convex sets containing $S$. In the figure above for example, the yellow, green and pink sets are all convex sets that contain $S$ but the smallest one is the pink one which is also the intersection of all three</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
Conv(S) = \text{ Intersection of all convex sets containing $S$ }
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
