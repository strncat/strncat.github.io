<h4><b>Proof:&lt;/h3&gt;
Let $$A \subseteq \mathbf{R}$$ be nonempty and bounded above, let $$c \in \mathbf{R}$$ and let $$cA = \{ca : a \in A\}$$. We'll verify both conditions of the least upper bound. Let $$a \in A$$. We know that $$a \leq \sup A$$. Multiply both sides by $$c$$ to get
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
ca \leq c\sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
This means that $$c\sup A$$ is an upper bound for $$cA$$ and this verifies condition one. To verify condition two, let $$b$$ be an arbitrary upper bound for $$cA$$. This means that
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
ca &amp;\leq b \\
a &amp;\leq b/c.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
This means that $$b/c$$ is an upper bound for $$A$$. But $$A$$ has a least upper bound $$\sup A$$ and we know by condition two that any upper bound is greater than or equal to $$\sup A$$ so
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
b/c &amp;\leq \sup A \\
b &amp;\leq c \sup A.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
Recall that $$b$$ was an arbitrary upper bound of $$cA$$. Therefore, we can conclude from this that $$c \sup A$$ is a least upper bound for $$cA$$ as required. $$\blacksquare$$
