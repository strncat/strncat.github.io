The following are just notes so I can fully follow along.
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Inner Semidirect Product Group</b></h4>
<p>Suppose we’re given two subgroups \(H, K \leq G\). We also know that \(HK = G\) and \(H \cap K = \{e\}\) (in this case, we call \(H\) and \(K\) complements). Consider the map</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: H \times K &amp;\rightarrow G \\
	              (h,k)  &amp;\rightarrow hk
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We want to show that \(\phi\) is a bijection. To do this, we’ll first show that \(\phi\) is injective. So given the elements \(h_1, h_2 \in H\) and \(k_1, k_2 \in K\) such that \(\phi(h_1,k_1) = \phi(h_2,k_2)\), we want to show that \((h_1,k_1) = (h_2,k_2)\). Observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(h_1,k_1) &amp;= \phi(h_2,k_2) \\
	h_1k_1 &amp;= h_2k_2 \\
	(h_2)^{-1}h_1k_1 &amp;= k_2 \\
	(h_2)^{-1}h_1k_1k_1^{-1} &amp;= k_2k_1^{-1} \\
	(h_2)^{-1}h_1 &amp;= k_2k_1^{-1} \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Since \((h_2)^{-1}h_1 \in H\) and \(k_2k_1^{-1} \in K\) and \((h_2)^{-1}h_1 = k_2k_1^{-1}\), then this value must be in the intersection \(H \cap K\). But \(H \cap K = \{e\}\). Therefore, this must be the identity element and so</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(h_2)^{-1}h_1 &amp;= k_2k_1^{-1} = e
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>But this just means that \((h_2)^{-1}h_1 = e\) and so \(h_1 = h_2\) and similarly \(k_1 = k_2\). Therefore \((h_1,k_1) = (h_2,k_2)\). So \(\phi\) is injective.
<br />
<br />
Next, we want to show that \(\phi\) is surjective. Notice that \(Im(\phi) = \{hk \ | \ h \in H, k \in K\} = HK = G\). This just means that \(\phi\) is surjective since the codomain in \(G\). Therefore, \(\phi\) is a bijection. 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>How to Make \(\phi\) a Homomorphism</b></h4>
<p>Now, suppose that we’re also given that \(H\) is normal. We know that \(\phi: H \times G \rightarrow G\) is a bijection. We also know that \(G\) is a group but we never defined \(H \times K\) as a group. We just said it was a set. The question is can we make \(H \times K\) a group so that \(\phi\) isn’t just a bijection but also an isomorphism? (hmmm, this is a iff right?)
<br />
<br />
We already know \(\phi\) is a bijection so we only need to show that \(\phi\) is a homomorphism. To be a homomorphism we need to prove that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi((h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2)) = \phi((h_1,k_1))\phi((h_2,k_2))
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Notice that we have NOT defined what the product will look like but we know that the right hand side is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	h_1k_1h_2k_2
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The goal is to write this product as a product of an element in \(H\) multiplied by an element from \(K\). This is exactly why we wanted or need \(H\) to be normal. So insert \(k_1^{-1}k_1\) as follows</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	h_1k_1h_2k_2 &amp;= h_1k_1h_2 (k_1^{-1}k_1) k_2 \\
	             &amp;= (h_1)(k_1h_2k_1^{-1}) (k_1k_2) \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Note here that the first two elements are in \(H\). \(h_1 \in H\) and \(k_1h_2k_1^{-1} \in H\) since \(H\) is normal. So we have exactly what we want. Why do we care? we want this because now we can write this as \(\phi\) of some \((h,k) \in H \times K\) where \(h = (h_1)(k_1h_2k_1^{-1})\) and \(k = (k_1k_2)\). So</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi((h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2)) &amp;= \phi((h_1,k_1))\phi((h_2,k_2)) \\
	                         &amp;= h_1k_1h_2k_2 \\
							 &amp;= (h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}) (k_1k_2) \\
	                         &amp;= \phi((h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}), k_1k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>

<p>But remember that \(\phi\) is a bijection so it’s injective. So saying that \(\phi((h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2)) = \phi((h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}), k_1k_2)\) implies that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) = (h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}, k_1k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This immediately gives us the required operation for \(G \times H\) to be a group. If we define this product above to be how we multiply elements in \(H \times K\), then \(\phi\) is a homomorphism and therefore, it is an isomorphism from \(G \times H \rightarrow G\). Since we already use \(G \times H\) to denote the direct product group, we use the notation \(G \rtimes K\) to denote this semidirect product group (internal semi direct product).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Outer Semidirect Product Group</b></h4>
<p>So now consider the groups \(H\) and \(K\). \(H\) and \(K\) are just two groups. They are not necessarily subgroups of \(G\). We want to find \(G\) such that \(G\) satisfies the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>\(H_G\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\)</li>
	<li>\(K_G\) is a subgroup of \(G\)</li>
	<li>\(H_G \cap K = \{e\}\)</li>
	<li>\(H_GK_G = G\)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that \(H_G\) is a subgroup of \(G\) that is isomorphic to \(H\) so it might not be \(H\) but at least it’s isomorphic to \(H\). So our goal here is to take two groups and make a new group such that this new group \(G\) is isomorphic to their direct product \(H \times K\).
<br />
<br />
So how can we make a group that satisfies these conditions? It’s important to remember that we don’t know anything about \(H\) or \(K\) and they might not be related. So we can’t just multiply \(hk\). We need a way to treat the elements of \(H\) and the elements of \(K\) separately. One way to do this is to use ordered pairs. What we can do is define the set of elements \(H \times K\) to be</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 H \times K = \{(h, k) \ | \ h \in H, k \in K\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This way, they stay separate. Additionally, this makes it easier to find the subgroups that we need. For example, we can define</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 H_G = H \times \{e_k\} &amp;= \{(h,e_K) \ | \ h \in H \} \quad \text{with the group product}\\
	 (h_1, e_K)&amp;(h_2, e_K) = (h_1h_2, e_K)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>And similarly define \(K_G\) as</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 K_G = \{e_H\} \times K &amp;= \{(e_H, k) \ | \ h \in H \}  \quad \text{with the group product}\\
	 (e_H, k_1)&amp;(e_H, k_2) = (e_H, k_1k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Using this construction, we can see that \(H_G \cap K_G = \{(e_H,e_K)\}\). Next, we want to show that \(H_GK_G = G\). By construction, \(H_GK_G = \{(h,e)(e,k)\}\). We defined \(G = H \times K\). What we want is have \(H_GK_G = G = H \times K\). In other words, we want</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 H_GK_G &amp;= \{(h,e)(e,k)\} = \{(h,k)\} = H \times K = G \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>One way to do this is to define the group \(H \times K\)’s product to be</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(h,e)(e,k) = (h,k)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This works and gives us the condition \(H_GK_G = G\). But this defines the product for these edge cases. What about the product of arbitrary elements \((h_1,k_1), (h_2,k_2) \in G = H \times K\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) &amp;= (h_1, e)(e, k_1)(h_2, e)(e, k_2) \quad \text{(using the product we defined)} \\
	                    &amp;=(h_1, e)(e, k_1)(h_2,e)[(e,k_1^{-1})(e,k_1)](e, k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Remember that we want \(H\) to be normal. So we’ll use the same trick from the inner product group in the first section and insert \((e,k_1^{-1})(e,k_1)\) in the middle. This means that \((e, k_1)(h_2,e)(e,k_1^{-1}) \in H\)
<br />
<br />
Now recall that conjugation by a element in a group is an automorphism.</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	   \gamma: G &amp;\rightarrow Aut(G) \\
	   \gamma_g(x) &amp;\rightarrow gxg^{-1}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>What is \(\gamma_{gh}\)?</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	   \gamma_{gh}(x) &amp;= ghx(gh)^{-1}  \\
	                  &amp;= g(hxh^{-1})g^{-1} \\
					  &amp;= g(\gamma_{h}(x))g^{-1} \\
					  &amp;= \gamma_g(\gamma_h(x)) \\
					  &amp;= \gamma_g \circ \gamma_h(x)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So \(\gamma\) is a group homomorphism. So going back to the group \(H \times K\)</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) &amp;=(h_1, e)[(e, k_1)(h_2,e)(e,k_1^{-1})](e,k_1)(e, k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We know that \(H_G\) is normal so if we conjugate any element in \(H_G\), the map will send it back to \(H_G\). So define the map</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	   \gamma: K &amp;\rightarrow Aut(H) \\
	   \gamma_k(x) &amp;\rightarrow khk^{-1}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We can use this to write the product</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) &amp;=(h_1, e)(\gamma_{k_1}(h_2),e)(e,k_1)(e, k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This \(\gamma\) just describes the conjugation of \(h_2\) by \(k_1\). And we already saw that this map is a homomorphism. Moreover, we can see the product above is now</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 (h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) &amp;=(h_1, e)(\gamma_{k_1}(h_2),e)(e,k_1)(e, k_2) \\
	                    &amp;=(h_1\gamma_{k_1}(h_2), e)(e, k_1k_2) \\
						&amp;=(h_1\gamma_{k_1}(h_2), k_1k_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Which is exactly why the semidirect product is defined that way!!!!!!!!!!

<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<p>Let \(Q_8 = \{1, -1, i, i, j, -j, k, -k\}\) be a group. We have the identities:</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, \quad ij = k, \quad ji = -k, \quad ijk = -1
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p><br />
\(ij = k\) is going in a clockwise direction while \(ji = -k\) is going in a counter clockwise direction.
TODO: Group diagram.
<br />
<br />
There are three cyclic subgroups of order 4: \(\langle i \rangle\), \(\langle j \rangle\) and \(\langle k \rangle\). There is one cyclic group of order 2: \(\langle -1 \rangle\). Note that \(\langle i \rangle = \{1, i, -1, -i\}\). 
<br />
<br />
Let’s find the cosets of \(\langle i \rangle\) in \(Q_8\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	j\langle i \rangle &amp;= j\{1, i, -1, -i\} = \{j, -k, -j, k\} \\
	\langle i \rangle j &amp;= \{1, i, -1, -i\}j = \{j, k, -j, -k\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Note that \(Q_8\) is generated by two elements \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (easy to check). Therefore, since \(j\langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle j\) and we checked all the generators of the group, then \(\langle i \rangle\) is a normal subgroup.
<br />
<br />
Let’s study the quotient group \(Q_8 / \langle i \rangle\). We know that it must contain two elements (By Lagrange’s Theorem).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	Q_8 / \langle i \rangle = \{\langle i \rangle, j \langle i \rangle\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p><br />
<br />
Recall, that we defined the multiplication of cosets by \((xN)(yN)=(xy)N\). Since we have two elements, observe that \(\langle i \rangle \langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle\). Multiply \(j \langle i \rangle\) by \(\langle i \rangle\) is just \(j \langle i \rangle\). Remember that \(\langle i \rangle\) acts as the identity element/coset here. So the only interesting product is \((j\langle i \rangle) (j\langle i \rangle)\) [TODO: add a table]</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(j\langle i \rangle) (j\langle i \rangle) &amp;= j^2 \langle i \rangle = -\langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle. 
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This multiplication table looks like the multiplication table of \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). In fact \(Q_8 / \langle i \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<p>Taking \(Q_8\) from before, let’s look at at the cyclic group generated by \(\langle -1 \rangle\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-1, 1\} 
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(\langle -1 \rangle\) is a normal subgroup (easy check, every element in the subgroup commutes with all elements in \(Q_8\)). So we now look at the quotient structure. (the cosets of \(\langle -1 \rangle\) in \(Q_8\))</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	i \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-i, i\} \\
	j \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-j, j\} \\
	k \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-k, k\} \\
	Q_8 / \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{i \langle -1 \rangle , i \langle -1 \rangle, j \langle -1 \rangle, k \langle -1 \rangle \}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Let’s calculate the order of each element. For example, \((i \langle -1 \rangle)^2 = -1\langle -1 \rangle = \langle -1 \rangle\). So \(o(i\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\). In fact, we also have \(o(j\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\) and \(o(k\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\). This isn’t cyclic so this group must be isomorphic to the non-cyclic group of order 4. So it’s isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_2\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 3</b></h4>
<p>Suppose that we are given</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: \mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n \\
	                 &amp;\phi(m) = [m] = \{k \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ k \equiv m (\bmod n)\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We want to show that \(\phi(m)\) is surjective. This is because for all \(0 \leq m \leq m - 1\), \(\phi(m) = [m]\) So we are able to hit every value of \(m\). It is also a homomorphism. since</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(m_1 + m_2) = [m_1 + m_2] = [m_1] + [m_2] = \phi(m_1) + \phi(m_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The kernel of \(\phi\) is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ m \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ [m] = [0]\} \\
	           &amp;= \{0, \pm n, \pm 2n,....\} = n\mathbf{Z}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now we have \(\ker(\phi) = n\mathbf{Z}\). We know that it is normal. We also showed that \(\phi\) is a surjective homomorphism. Therefore, by the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}/n\mathbf{Z} \cong \mathbf{Z}_n\).

<h4><b>Example 4</b></h4>
<p>Next, let’s take</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: \mathbf{Z}_4 &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\
	        &amp;\phi([m]_4) = [m]_2 
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Here, it is not obvious this is well-defined. So let’s check that it is. Suppose that \([m_1]_4 = [m_2]_4\). We want to show that \(\phi([m_1]_4) = \phi([m_2]_4)\). Observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	[m_1]_4 &amp;= [m_2]_4 \\
	[m_1]_4 - [m_2]_4 &amp;= [0]_4 \\
	[m_1 - m_2]_4 &amp;= [0]_4 \\
	m_1-m_2 &amp;\equiv 0 \bmod 4
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This says that \(m_1 - m_2\) must be a multiple of 4 so \(m_1 - m_2 = 4k = 2(2k)\) for some \(k \in \mathbf{Z}\). So \(m_1 - m_2\) is also a multiple of 2. Therefore, \(m_1-m_2 \equiv 0 \bmod 2\) and so \([m_1]_2 = [m_2]_2\).
<br />
<br />
\(\phi\) is also a homomorphism. since</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi([m_1]_4 + [m_2]_4) = \phi([m_1 + m_2]_4) = [m_1 + m_2]_2 = [m_1]_2 + [m_2]_2 = \phi(m_1) + \phi(m_2).
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Next we want to show that \(\phi\) is surjective. Notice that there are two values in the target domain. \([0]_2\) and \([1]_2\). Also note that \(\phi([0]_4) = [0]_2\) and \(\phi([1]_4) = [1]_2\) so it is surjective.
<br />
<br />
The kernel of \(\phi\) is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ [m]_4 \in \mathbf{Z}_4 \ | \ \phi([m]_4) = [0]_2\} \\
	           &amp;= \{ [m]_4 \in \mathbf{Z}_4 \ | \ [m]_2 = [0]_2\} \\
			   &amp;= \{ [0]_4, [2]_4 \} = \langle [2]_4 \rangle = 2\mathbf{Z}_4 \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now we have \(\ker(\phi) = \langle [2]_4 \rangle\). We know that it is normal. We also showed that \(\phi\) is a surjective homomorphism. Therefore, by the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}_4/\langle [2]_4 \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\).

<h4><b>Example 5</b></h4>
<p>Next, let’s take</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: \mathbf{Z}_6 &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_{15}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We need to figure out a homomorphism. First recall that for any element, \(|\phi(x)| \ | \ |x|\). Let’s list the order of the elements in \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\). Notice here that \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\) is a cyclic group (with addition) so the order of any element \(g + a\) is going to be \(\frac{15}{gcd(a,15)}\)</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	&amp;o(1): [0]_{15} \\
	&amp;o(3): [5]_{15}, [10]_{15} \\
	&amp;o(5): [3]_{15}, [6]_{15}, [9]_{15}, [12]_{15} \\
	&amp;o(15): [1]_{15}, [2]_{15}, [4]_{15}, [7]_{15}, [11]_{15}, [13]_{15}, [14]_{15} \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now let’s pick \([1]_{6}\). It is a generator for \(\mathbf{Z}_{6}\). We know that \(\phi([1]_6)\) must divide the order of the element itself so \(|[1]_6| = 6\). So that tells us that \(|\phi([1]_6)|\) must be either 1,2,3 or 6. 2 and 6 are not possibilities so we don’t have any elements of that order in \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\). So it’s either 1 or 3.
<br />
<br />
Case 1: Suppose we pick some element of order 1. That means that \(\phi([1]_6) = 1\). This implies that \(\phi([1]_6) = [0]_{15}\). Since it’s a generator, then \(\ker(\phi) = \mathbf{Z}_6\). And \(Im(\phi) = \{[0]_{15}\}\). This gives us \(\mathbf{Z}_6/\mathbf{Z}_6 = \{[0]_{15}\} \leq \mathbf{Z}_{15}\). So it’s pretty boring.
<br />
<br />
Case 2: Suppose we pick some element of order 3 so \(|\phi([1]_6)| = 3\). So let \(\phi([1]_6) = [5]_{15}\). Based on this, where will \([2]_6\) will go? Remember that we want \(\phi\) to be a homomorphism. This means that we want this to be true. That \(\phi([2]_6) = \phi([1 + 1]_6) = \phi([1]_6) + \phi([1]_6) = [5]_{15} + [5_{15} = [10]_{15}\). So we want to pick \([10]_{15}\) for \([2]_6\). Based on this, the elements will get mapped to</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	[0]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [0]_{15} \\
	[1]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [5]_{15} \\
	[2]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [10]_{15} \\
	[3]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [0]_{15} \\
	[4]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [5]_{15} \\
	[5]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [10]_{15}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So the image of our homomorphism is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	Im(\phi) = \{[0]_{15}, [5]_{15}, [10]_{15}\} = \langle [5]_{15} \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_3
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The last statement is because all cyclic groups of order 3 are isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_3\). The kernel of \(\phi\) is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ [m]_6 \in \mathbf{Z}_6 \ | \ \phi([m]_6) = [0]_{15}\} \\
			   &amp;= \{ [0]_6, [3]_{6} \} = \langle [3]_6 \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>By the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}_{6}/\langle [3]_6 \rangle \cong \langle [5]_{15} \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_3\).
<br />

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 6</b></h4>
<p>Next, let’s take</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	D_n = \langle r,s \ | \ r^n = s^2 = e, rs = sr^{n-1} \rangle
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To define a homomorphism, we need these defining identities to hold on both sides. So let’s define</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: D_n &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\
	      r  &amp;\rightarrow 0 \quad \text{we don't to write $[0]_2$ since it's clear} \\
		  s &amp;\rightarrow 1
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So now we need to verify that the three defining relations are satisfied. For example, we know that \(r^n = e\). So we want \(\phi(r^n) = \phi(e) = [0]\). But this is also</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(r^n) = \phi(rr...r) = \phi(r)+...\phi(r) = 0+...+0 = 0.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Similarly, we have \(\phi(s^2) = \phi(e) = [0]\) and at the same time</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(s^2) = \phi(ss) = \phi(s)+\phi(s) = 1 + 1 = 0
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Finally, we have \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{n-1})\). We can check both sides</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(rs) &amp;= \phi(r) + \phi(s) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\
	\phi(sr^{n-1}) &amp;= \phi(s) + \phi(r) + ... + \phi(r) = 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Next, we need to see that it is surjective but that’s trivial since we’re sending \(r\) to \(0\) and \(s\) to \(1\) so it’s definitely surjective. The image of \(\phi\) is \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). The kernel is also easy to see</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ l \in D_n \ | \ \phi(l) = 0\} \\
			   &amp;= \langle r \rangle \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is because any rotation is sent to 0 and any reflection \(\phi(r^ks) = \phi(sr^{n-k} = 1\).<br />
By the Isomorphism Theorem, \(D_n/\langle r \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\).

<h4><b>Example 7</b></h4>
<p>Let’s continue with the dihedral group and suppose we have</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	D_n = \langle r,s \ | \ r^n = s^2 = e, rs = sr^{n-1} \rangle
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To define a homomorphism, we need these defining identities to hold on both sides. So let’s define</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: D_n &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n \\
	      r  &amp;\rightarrow 1 \\
		  s &amp;\rightarrow 0
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Is this a homomorphism? Let’s check the identity \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{n-1})\). We can check both sides</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(rs) &amp;= \phi(r) + \phi(s) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\
	\phi(sr^{n-1}) &amp;= \phi(s) + (\phi(r) + ... + \phi(r)) = 0 + n - 1 = n - 1.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Note that \(1 \not\equiv n - 1 \bmod n\) unless \(n = 2\). So it’s not a homomorphism for any \(n &gt; 2\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 8</b></h4>
<p>Let’s take another dihedral group example. Define</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	D_{2n} = \langle r,s \ | \ r^{2n} = s^2 = e, rs = sr^{2n-1} \rangle
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>And then define</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: D_{2n} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\
	      r  &amp;\rightarrow 1 \\
		  s &amp;\rightarrow 0
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We need to verify that the three defining relations are satisfied. For example, we know that \(r^{2n} = e\). So we want \(\phi(r^{2n}) = \phi(e) = [0]\). But this is also</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(r^{2n}) = 2n\phi(r) = [2n]_2 = 0.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Similarly, we have \(\phi(s^2) = \phi(e) = [0]\) and at the same time</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(s^2) = \phi(ss) = \phi(s)+\phi(s) = 0
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Finally, we have \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{n-1})\). We can check both sides</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(rs) &amp;= \phi(r) + \phi(s) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\
	\phi(sr^{2n-1}) &amp;= 0 + 2n-1 = [2n-1]_2 = 1
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So \(\phi\) is a homomorphism. It is surjective since we hit both elements in the target. Next we’ll calculate the kernel.</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ l \in D_n \ | \ \phi(l) = [0]_2\} \\
	           &amp;= \{e, r^2, r^4 ... r^{2n-2}, s, sr^2 ... sr^{2n-2} \} \\
			   &amp;= \langle s, r^2 \rangle \leq D_{2n}\\
			   &amp;= \langle s, r^2 \ | \ s^2=(r^2)^{n} = e, r^2s = s(r^2)^{n-1} \rangle \cong D_n
	\end{align*}

<p>By the Isomorphism Theorem, \(D_{2n}/D_n \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\).

<h4><b>Example 11</b></h4>
<p>Suppose now we have the following map</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: D_{6} &amp;\rightarrow S_6 \\
	      r  &amp;\rightarrow (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6) \\
		  s &amp;\rightarrow (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is easy to see if we draw a hexagon and label the vertices as follows</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/extra/1.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>So we can see that a reflection about the \(y\) axis is represented by the above map. So now we want to check if \(\phi\) defines a homomorphism. We do this by checking the defining relations in \(D_6\) So we want \(\phi(r^6) = \phi(e) = (1) = e_{S_6}\). But this is also</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(r^6) = (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)^6 = e
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Similarly, we have \(\phi(s^2) = \phi(e) = [0]\) and it easy to check that we do get \(\phi(s^2) = e\). Finally, we have \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{5})\). We can check both sides</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi(rs) &amp;= (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6) (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) = (1)(2 \ 6)(3 \ 5)(4) = (2 \ 6)(3 \ 5) \\
	\phi(sr^{n-1}) &amp;= (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)^5 \\
	               &amp;= (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) (1 \ 6 \ 5 \ 4 \ 3 \ 2) \quad \text{(we can count by 5)} \\
				   &amp;= (1)(2 \ 6)(3 \ 5)(4) = (2 \ 6)(3 \ 5) 
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The image of \(\phi\) is going to be generating by \((1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)\) and \((1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4)\)</p>

	$$
</div>
<p>We claim that the kernel only contains the identity. Why? note that \(|r| = 6\) and the order of its image is \(|(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)|\). This tells us</p>
<div>

	\begin{align*}

We have the identities: $$ \begin{align*} i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, \quad ij = k, \quad ji = -k, \quad ijk = -1 \end{align*} $$ \(ij = k\) is going in a clockwise direction while \(ji = -k\) is going in a counter clockwise direction. TODO: Group diagram. There are three cyclic subgroups of order 4: \(\langle i \rangle\), \(\langle j \rangle\) and \(\langle k \rangle\). There is one cyclic group of order 2: \(\langle -1 \rangle\). Note that \(\langle i \rangle = \{1, i, -1, -i\}\). Let’s find the cosets of \(\langle i \rangle\) in \(Q_8\). $$ \begin{align*} j\langle i \rangle &amp;= j\{1, i, -1, -i\} = \{j, -k, -j, k\} \\ \langle i \rangle j &amp;= \{1, i, -1, -i\}j = \{j, k, -j, -k\} \end{align*} $$ Note that \(Q_8\) is generated by two elements \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (easy to check). Therefore, since \(j\langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle j\) and we checked all the generators of the group, then \(\langle i \rangle\) is a normal subgroup. Let’s study the quotient group \(Q_8 / \langle i \rangle\). We know that it must contain two elements (By Lagrange’s Theorem). $$ \begin{align*} Q_8 / \langle i \rangle = \{\langle i \rangle, j \langle i \rangle\} \end{align*} $$ Recall, that we defined the multiplication of cosets by \((xN)(yN)=(xy)N\). Since we have two elements, observe that \(\langle i \rangle \langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle\). Multiply \(j \langle i \rangle\) by \(\langle i \rangle\) is just \(j \langle i \rangle\). Remember that \(\langle i \rangle\) acts as the identity element/coset here. So the only interesting product is \((j\langle i \rangle) (j\langle i \rangle)\) [TODO: add a table] $$ \begin{align*} (j\langle i \rangle) (j\langle i \rangle) &amp;= j^2 \langle i \rangle = -\langle i \rangle = \langle i \rangle. \end{align*} $$ This multiplication table looks like the multiplication table of \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). In fact \(Q_8 / \langle i \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\). Example 2 Taking \(Q_8\) from before, let’s look at at the cyclic group generated by \(\langle -1 \rangle\). $$ \begin{align*} \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-1, 1\} \end{align*} $$ \(\langle -1 \rangle\) is a normal subgroup (easy check, every element in the subgroup commutes with all elements in \(Q_8\)). So we now look at the quotient structure. (the cosets of \(\langle -1 \rangle\) in \(Q_8\)) $$ \begin{align*} i \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-i, i\} \\ j \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-j, j\} \\ k \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{-k, k\} \\ Q_8 / \langle -1 \rangle &amp;= \{i \langle -1 \rangle , i \langle -1 \rangle, j \langle -1 \rangle, k \langle -1 \rangle \} \end{align*} $$ Let’s calculate the order of each element. For example, \((i \langle -1 \rangle)^2 = -1\langle -1 \rangle = \langle -1 \rangle\). So \(o(i\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\). In fact, we also have \(o(j\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\) and \(o(k\langle -1 \rangle) = 2\). This isn’t cyclic so this group must be isomorphic to the non-cyclic group of order 4. So it’s isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_2\). Example 3 Suppose that we are given $$ \begin{align*} \phi: \mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n \\ &amp;\phi(m) = [m] = \{k \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ k \equiv m (\bmod n)\} \end{align*} $$ We want to show that \(\phi(m)\) is surjective. This is because for all \(0 \leq m \leq m - 1\), \(\phi(m) = [m]\) So we are able to hit every value of \(m\). It is also a homomorphism. since $$ \begin{align*} \phi(m_1 + m_2) = [m_1 + m_2] = [m_1] + [m_2] = \phi(m_1) + \phi(m_2) \end{align*} $$ The kernel of \(\phi\) is $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ m \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ [m] = [0]\} \\ &amp;= \{0, \pm n, \pm 2n,....\} = n\mathbf{Z} \end{align*} $$ So now we have \(\ker(\phi) = n\mathbf{Z}\). We know that it is normal. We also showed that \(\phi\) is a surjective homomorphism. Therefore, by the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}/n\mathbf{Z} \cong \mathbf{Z}_n\). Example 4 Next, let’s take $$ \begin{align*} \phi: \mathbf{Z}_4 &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\ &amp;\phi([m]_4) = [m]_2 \end{align*} $$ Here, it is not obvious this is well-defined. So let’s check that it is. Suppose that \([m_1]_4 = [m_2]_4\). We want to show that \(\phi([m_1]_4) = \phi([m_2]_4)\). Observe that $$ \begin{align*} [m_1]_4 &amp;= [m_2]_4 \\ [m_1]_4 - [m_2]_4 &amp;= [0]_4 \\ [m_1 - m_2]_4 &amp;= [0]_4 \\ m_1-m_2 &amp;\equiv 0 \bmod 4 \end{align*} $$ This says that \(m_1 - m_2\) must be a multiple of 4 so \(m_1 - m_2 = 4k = 2(2k)\) for some \(k \in \mathbf{Z}\). So \(m_1 - m_2\) is also a multiple of 2. Therefore, \(m_1-m_2 \equiv 0 \bmod 2\) and so \([m_1]_2 = [m_2]_2\). \(\phi\) is also a homomorphism. since $$ \begin{align*} \phi([m_1]_4 + [m_2]_4) = \phi([m_1 + m_2]_4) = [m_1 + m_2]_2 = [m_1]_2 + [m_2]_2 = \phi(m_1) + \phi(m_2). \end{align*} $$ Next we want to show that \(\phi\) is surjective. Notice that there are two values in the target domain. \([0]_2\) and \([1]_2\). Also note that \(\phi([0]_4) = [0]_2\) and \(\phi([1]_4) = [1]_2\) so it is surjective. The kernel of \(\phi\) is $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ [m]_4 \in \mathbf{Z}_4 \ | \ \phi([m]_4) = [0]_2\} \\ &amp;= \{ [m]_4 \in \mathbf{Z}_4 \ | \ [m]_2 = [0]_2\} \\ &amp;= \{ [0]_4, [2]_4 \} = \langle [2]_4 \rangle = 2\mathbf{Z}_4 \\ \end{align*} $$ So now we have \(\ker(\phi) = \langle [2]_4 \rangle\). We know that it is normal. We also showed that \(\phi\) is a surjective homomorphism. Therefore, by the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}_4/\langle [2]_4 \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\). Example 5 Next, let’s take $$ \begin{align*} \phi: \mathbf{Z}_6 &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_{15} \end{align*} $$ We need to figure out a homomorphism. First recall that for any element, \(|\phi(x)| \ | \ |x|\). Let’s list the order of the elements in \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\). Notice here that \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\) is a cyclic group (with addition) so the order of any element \(g + a\) is going to be \(\frac{15}{gcd(a,15)}\) $$ \begin{align*} &amp;o(1): [0]_{15} \\ &amp;o(3): [5]_{15}, [10]_{15} \\ &amp;o(5): [3]_{15}, [6]_{15}, [9]_{15}, [12]_{15} \\ &amp;o(15): [1]_{15}, [2]_{15}, [4]_{15}, [7]_{15}, [11]_{15}, [13]_{15}, [14]_{15} \\ \end{align*} $$ So now let’s pick \([1]_{6}\). It is a generator for \(\mathbf{Z}_{6}\). We know that \(\phi([1]_6)\) must divide the order of the element itself so \(|[1]_6| = 6\). So that tells us that \(|\phi([1]_6)|\) must be either 1,2,3 or 6. 2 and 6 are not possibilities so we don’t have any elements of that order in \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\). So it’s either 1 or 3. Case 1: Suppose we pick some element of order 1. That means that \(\phi([1]_6) = 1\). This implies that \(\phi([1]_6) = [0]_{15}\). Since it’s a generator, then \(\ker(\phi) = \mathbf{Z}_6\). And \(Im(\phi) = \{[0]_{15}\}\). This gives us \(\mathbf{Z}_6/\mathbf{Z}_6 = \{[0]_{15}\} \leq \mathbf{Z}_{15}\). So it’s pretty boring. Case 2: Suppose we pick some element of order 3 so \(|\phi([1]_6)| = 3\). So let \(\phi([1]_6) = [5]_{15}\). Based on this, where will \([2]_6\) will go? Remember that we want \(\phi\) to be a homomorphism. This means that we want this to be true. That \(\phi([2]_6) = \phi([1 + 1]_6) = \phi([1]_6) + \phi([1]_6) = [5]_{15} + [5_{15} = [10]_{15}\). So we want to pick \([10]_{15}\) for \([2]_6\). Based on this, the elements will get mapped to $$ \begin{align*} [0]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [0]_{15} \\ [1]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [5]_{15} \\ [2]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [10]_{15} \\ [3]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [0]_{15} \\ [4]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [5]_{15} \\ [5]_6 &amp;\rightarrow [10]_{15}. \end{align*} $$ So the image of our homomorphism is $$ \begin{align*} Im(\phi) = \{[0]_{15}, [5]_{15}, [10]_{15}\} = \langle [5]_{15} \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_3 \end{align*} $$ The last statement is because all cyclic groups of order 3 are isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_3\). The kernel of \(\phi\) is $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ [m]_6 \in \mathbf{Z}_6 \ | \ \phi([m]_6) = [0]_{15}\} \\ &amp;= \{ [0]_6, [3]_{6} \} = \langle [3]_6 \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\\ \end{align*} $$ By the Isomorphism Theorem, \(\mathbf{Z}_{6}/\langle [3]_6 \rangle \cong \langle [5]_{15} \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_3\). Example 6 Next, let’s take $$ \begin{align*} D_n = \langle r,s \ | \ r^n = s^2 = e, rs = sr^{n-1} \rangle \end{align*} $$ To define a homomorphism, we need these defining identities to hold on both sides. So let’s define $$ \begin{align*} \phi: D_n &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\ r &amp;\rightarrow 0 \quad \text{we don't to write $[0]_2$ since it's clear} \\ s &amp;\rightarrow 1 \end{align*} $$ So now we need to verify that the three defining relations are satisfied. For example, we know that \(r^n = e\). So we want \(\phi(r^n) = \phi(e) = [0]\). But this is also $$ \begin{align*} \phi(r^n) = \phi(rr...r) = \phi(r)+...\phi(r) = 0+...+0 = 0. \end{align*} $$ Similarly, we have \(\phi(s^2) = \phi(e) = [0]\) and at the same time $$ \begin{align*} \phi(s^2) = \phi(ss) = \phi(s)+\phi(s) = 1 + 1 = 0 \end{align*} $$ Finally, we have \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{n-1})\). We can check both sides $$ \begin{align*} \phi(rs) &amp;= \phi(r) + \phi(s) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\ \phi(sr^{n-1}) &amp;= \phi(s) + \phi(r) + ... + \phi(r) = 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1 \end{align*} $$ Next, we need to see that it is surjective but that’s trivial since we’re sending \(r\) to \(0\) and \(s\) to \(1\) so it’s definitely surjective. The image of \(\phi\) is \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). The kernel is also easy to see $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ l \in D_n \ | \ \phi(l) = 0\} \\ &amp;= \langle r \rangle \\ \end{align*} $$ This is because any rotation is sent to 0 and any reflection \(\phi(r^ks) = \phi(sr^{n-k} = 1\). By the Isomorphism Theorem, \(D_n/\langle r \rangle \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\). Example 7 Let’s continue with the dihedral group and suppose we have $$ \begin{align*} D_n = \langle r,s \ | \ r^n = s^2 = e, rs = sr^{n-1} \rangle \end{align*} $$ To define a homomorphism, we need these defining identities to hold on both sides. So let’s define $$ \begin{align*} \phi: D_n &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n \\ r &amp;\rightarrow 1 \\ s &amp;\rightarrow 0 \end{align*} $$ Is this a homomorphism? Let’s check the identity \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{n-1})\). We can check both sides $$ \begin{align*} \phi(rs) &amp;= \phi(r) + \phi(s) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\ \phi(sr^{n-1}) &amp;= \phi(s) + (\phi(r) + ... + \phi(r)) = 0 + n - 1 = n - 1. \end{align*} $$ Note that \(1 \not\equiv n - 1 \bmod n\) unless \(n = 2\). So it’s not a homomorphism for any \(n &gt; 2\). Example 8 Let’s take another dihedral group example. Define $$ \begin{align*} D_{2n} = \langle r,s \ | \ r^{2n} = s^2 = e, rs = sr^{2n-1} \rangle \end{align*} $$ And then define $$ \begin{align*} \phi: D_{2n} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_2 \\ r &amp;\rightarrow 1 \\ s &amp;\rightarrow 0 \end{align*} $$ We need to verify that the three defining relations are satisfied. For example, we know that \(r^{2n} = e\). So we want \(\phi(r^{2n}) = \phi(e) = [0]\). But this is also $$ \begin{align*} \phi(r^{2n}) = 2n\phi(r) = [2n]_2 = 0. \end{align*} $$ Similarly, we have \(\phi(s^2) = \phi(e) = [0]\) and at the same time $$ \begin{align*} \phi(s^2) = \phi(ss) = \phi(s)+\phi(s) = 0 \end{align*} $$ Finally, we have \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{n-1})\). We can check both sides $$ \begin{align*} \phi(rs) &amp;= \phi(r) + \phi(s) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\ \phi(sr^{2n-1}) &amp;= 0 + 2n-1 = [2n-1]_2 = 1 \end{align*} $$ So \(\phi\) is a homomorphism. It is surjective since we hit both elements in the target. Next we’ll calculate the kernel. $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ l \in D_n \ | \ \phi(l) = [0]_2\} \\ &amp;= \{e, r^2, r^4 ... r^{2n-2}, s, sr^2 ... sr^{2n-2} \} \\ &amp;= \langle s, r^2 \rangle \leq D_{2n}\\ &amp;= \langle s, r^2 \ | \ s^2=(r^2)^{n} = e, r^2s = s(r^2)^{n-1} \rangle \cong D_n \end{align*} $$ By the Isomorphism Theorem, \(D_{2n}/D_n \cong \mathbf{Z}_2\). Example 11 Suppose now we have the following map $$ \begin{align*} \phi: D_{6} &amp;\rightarrow S_6 \\ r &amp;\rightarrow (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6) \\ s &amp;\rightarrow (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) \end{align*} $$ This is easy to see if we draw a hexagon and label the vertices as follows So we can see that a reflection about the \(y\) axis is represented by the above map. So now we want to check if \(\phi\) defines a homomorphism. We do this by checking the defining relations in \(D_6\) So we want \(\phi(r^6) = \phi(e) = (1) = e_{S_6}\). But this is also $$ \begin{align*} \phi(r^6) = (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)^6 = e \end{align*} $$ Similarly, we have \(\phi(s^2) = \phi(e) = [0]\) and it easy to check that we do get \(\phi(s^2) = e\). Finally, we have \(\phi(rs) = \phi(sr^{5})\). We can check both sides $$ \begin{align*} \phi(rs) &amp;= (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6) (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) = (1)(2 \ 6)(3 \ 5)(4) = (2 \ 6)(3 \ 5) \\ \phi(sr^{n-1}) &amp;= (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)^5 \\ &amp;= (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) (1 \ 6 \ 5 \ 4 \ 3 \ 2) \quad \text{(we can count by 5)} \\ &amp;= (1)(2 \ 6)(3 \ 5)(4) = (2 \ 6)(3 \ 5) \end{align*} $$ The image of \(\phi\) is going to be generating by \((1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)\) and \((1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4)\) $$ \begin{align*} im(\phi) &amp;= \langle (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6), (1 \ 6)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 4) \rangle \\ \end{align*} $$ We claim that the kernel only contains the identity. Why? note that \(|r| = 6\) and the order of its image is \(|(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)|\). This tells us $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\phi) &amp;= \{ l \in D_n \ | \ \phi(l) = 0\} \\ &amp;= \langle r \rangle \\ \end{align*} $$ References The order of an element in a direct group is the lcm of both elements orders Isomorphism Examples]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Study Notes: Extra Proofs …</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/14/math417-extra-proofs.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Study Notes: Extra Proofs …" /><published>2025-02-14T00:01:36-08:00</published><updated>2025-02-14T00:01:36-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/14/math417-extra-proofs</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/14/math417-extra-proofs.html"><![CDATA[<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>

\(\longrightarrow:\) Suppose \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n \cong \mathbf{Z}_{mn}\). Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(gcd(m,n) = d &gt; 1\).

<p>Notice here that both \(\frac{n}{d}\) and \(\frac{m}{d}\) are whole numbers since \(d\) is a divisor of both \(m\) and \(n\). So the first entry is a multiple of \(m\) while the second entry is a multiple of \(n\). This implies that the order of \((a,b) \leq \frac{mn}{d} &lt; mn\). So the order of any element \((a,b) \in \mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\) is strictly less than \(mn\). This means that no element of \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\) can be a generator of the group. So \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\) is not cyclic. This is a contradiction because \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\) isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_{mn}\) and so it is cyclic. 
<br />
<br />
\(\longleftarrow:\) Now suppose that \(gcd(m,n) = 1\). We want to show that \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_{mn}\). Notice that the order of the element 1 has order \(m\) in \(\mathbf{Z}_m\) and the order of the element 1 has order \(n\) in \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). This tells us that the order of \((1,1) = lcm(m,n) \frac{mn}{gcd(m,n)} \frac{mn}{1} = mn\). So \((1,1)\) has order \(mn\) which means it generates the group. So it must be cyclic. So \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n = \langle (1,1) \rangle\). We know all cyclic groups that have the same order are isomorphic. So \(\mathbf{Z}_m \times \mathbf{Z}_n \cong \mathbf{Z}_{mn}\).

Why is that? When we previously discussed classifying finite groups, we wanted to classify the groups of a certain finite order up to an isomorphism. We asked the question “what are the groups up to isomorphism that are of order 6 for example?” This is a hard question in general. However, if we restricted the domain to only finite abelian groups, it turns out that it is a much easier task to describe and classify the groups that are finite abelian up to isomorphism for any order. Though it will require a lot of hard work to prove these classifications. 
<br />
<br />
We’ll start with this important fact: <br />
<b>Key Fact</b>: Every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a finite product of finite cyclic groups.</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		G \cong \mathbf{Z}_{n_1} \times \mathbf{Z}_{n_2} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}_{n_k}, \quad k \geq 0,n_1,...,n_k \geq 1
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>Question: How do you factor the trivial group? (you can think of it as a group with no factors). This can be problematic if we have multiple ways to factor this. Meaning that \(G\) could be isomorphic in more than one way? Recall that the Chinese Remainder Theorem states that
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
if \(a = a_1a_2...,a_k\) where \(a_1,...,a_k\) are relatively prime and \(a_i \geq 1\). Then
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\mathbf{Z}_a \cong \mathbf{Z}_{a_1} \times ...\times \mathbf{Z}_{a_k}

For example, \(\mathbf{60} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{4} \times \mathbf{Z}_{15} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{4} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3} \times \mathbf{Z}_{5}\).
So how do we know?

<h4><b>Elementary Divisor Classification</b></h4>
<p>As a start we have the following classification theorem
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Every finite abelian group \(G\) is isomorphic to a group of the following form
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	G \cong \mathbf{Z}_{p_1^{r_1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{p_2^{r_2}} ...\times \mathbf{Z}_{p_k^{r_k}}
	\end{align*}
	$$
where \(k \geq 0, r_1 \geq 1, p_1,p_2,...,p_k\) are primes.
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the list \(p_1^{r_1}, p_2^{r_2}, ..., p_k^{r_k}\) of elementary divisors is unique up to re-ordering.
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
So if \(G\) is isomorphic to only one direct product of cyclic prime orders. This means that if \(G\) is isomorphic to a direct products of prime orders and it’s also isomorphic to another list of direct products of prime orders. Then, the prime numbers must be exactly the same up to re-ordering. 
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
For example, if \(|G| = 24\) and \(G\) is abelian. 24 has the prime factorization \(24 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3\). Thus, \(G\) is isomorphic to one of the following</p>
<ol>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{3}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}}\). Note here that this group is cyclic by the Chinese Remainder Theorem since \(8\) and \(3\) are relatively prime.</li>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{2}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \)</li>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}}\)</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Invariant Factor Classification</b></h4>
<p>We have another classification Theorem. 
<br /></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Every finite abelian group \(G\) is isomorphic to a group of the following form
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	G \cong \mathbf{Z}_{a_1} \times \mathbf{Z}_{a_2} ...\times \mathbf{Z}_{a_s}
	\end{align*}
	$$
where \(s \geq 0, a_1 \geq 2\) and \(a_i \ | \ a_{i+1}\).
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the list \(a_1, a_2,...,a_s\) of "Invariant Factors" is unique.
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

So if we look at the previous example, we can see that</p>
<ol>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{3}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{24}\).</li>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{2}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{12}\). Note how each factor divides the factor coming after it. </li>
	<li>\(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{6}\). Same here 2 divides 2 and then the next 2 divides 6</li>

Why is that? When we previously discussed classifying finite groups, we wanted to classify the groups of a certain finite order up to an isomorphism. We asked the question “what are the groups up to isomorphism that are of order 6 for example?” This is a hard question in general. However, if we restricted the domain to only finite abelian groups, it turns out that it is a much easier task to describe and classify the groups that are finite abelian up to isomorphism for any order. Though it will require a lot of hard work to prove these classifications. We’ll start with this important fact: Key Fact: Every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a finite product of finite cyclic groups. $$ \begin{align*} G \cong \mathbf{Z}_{n_1} \times \mathbf{Z}_{n_2} \times ... \times \mathbf{Z}_{n_k}, \quad k \geq 0,n_1,...,n_k \geq 1 \end{align*} $$ Question: How do you factor the trivial group? (you can think of it as a group with no factors). This can be problematic if we have multiple ways to factor this. Meaning that \(G\) could be isomorphic in more than one way? Recall that the Chinese Remainder Theorem states that Theorem if \(a = a_1a_2...,a_k\) where \(a_1,...,a_k\) are relatively prime and \(a_i \geq 1\). Then $$ \begin{align*} \mathbf{Z}_a \cong \mathbf{Z}_{a_1} \times ...\times \mathbf{Z}_{a_k} \end{align*} $$ For example, \(\mathbf{60} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{4} \times \mathbf{Z}_{15} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{4} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3} \times \mathbf{Z}_{5}\). So how do we know? Elementary Divisor Classification As a start we have the following classification theorem Theorem Every finite abelian group \(G\) is isomorphic to a group of the following form $$ \begin{align*} G \cong \mathbf{Z}_{p_1^{r_1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{p_2^{r_2}} ...\times \mathbf{Z}_{p_k^{r_k}} \end{align*} $$ where \(k \geq 0, r_1 \geq 1, p_1,p_2,...,p_k\) are primes. Furthermore, the list \(p_1^{r_1}, p_2^{r_2}, ..., p_k^{r_k}\) of elementary divisors is unique up to re-ordering. So if \(G\) is isomorphic to only one direct product of cyclic prime orders. This means that if \(G\) is isomorphic to a direct products of prime orders and it’s also isomorphic to another list of direct products of prime orders. Then, the prime numbers must be exactly the same up to re-ordering. For example, if \(|G| = 24\) and \(G\) is abelian. 24 has the prime factorization \(24 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3\). Thus, \(G\) is isomorphic to one of the following \(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{3}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}}\). Note here that this group is cyclic by the Chinese Remainder Theorem since \(8\) and \(3\) are relatively prime. \(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{2}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \) \(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}}\) Invariant Factor Classification We have another classification Theorem. Theorem Every finite abelian group \(G\) is isomorphic to a group of the following form $$ \begin{align*} G \cong \mathbf{Z}_{a_1} \times \mathbf{Z}_{a_2} ...\times \mathbf{Z}_{a_s} \end{align*} $$ where \(s \geq 0, a_1 \geq 2\) and \(a_i \ | \ a_{i+1}\). Furthermore, the list \(a_1, a_2,...,a_s\) of "Invariant Factors" is unique. So if we look at the previous example, we can see that \(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{3}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{24}\). \(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{2}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{12}\). Note how each factor divides the factor coming after it. \(\mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2^{1}} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^{1}} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{6}\). Same here 2 divides 2 and then the next 2 divides 6 Also note that if have the invariant factors decomposition, then we can easily convert back to the elementary divisor decomposition. For example, suppose that \(G\) is finite abelian with invariant factors \(5,25,50,36000\). Then \(5 = 5 \times 1, \quad \mathbf{Z}_5 \cong \mathbf{Z}_5\) \(25 = 5^2, \quad \mathbf{Z}_5 \cong \mathbf{Z}_{5^2}\) \(50 = 2^1 \times 5^2, \quad \mathbf{Z}_{50} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{2^1} \times \mathbf{Z}_{5^2}\) \(36000 = 2^5 \times 3^2 \times 5^3, \quad \mathbf{Z}_{36000} \cong \mathbf{Z}_{2^5} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{5^3}\) So \(G\) is isomorphic to both $$ \begin{align*} G &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}_{5} \times \mathbf{Z}_{25} \times \mathbf{Z}_{30} \times \mathbf{Z}_{36000} \\ &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}_{2^6} \times \mathbf{Z}_{3^2} \times \mathbf{Z}_{5^8} \end{align*} $$ We can also start with the elementary divisors and get the invariant factors from them.

As a reminder
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem (Recognition Theorem)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and \(A, N \leq G\). If
<ol>
	<li>\(A\) and \(N\) are normal subgroups of \(G\).</li>
	<li>\(A \cap N = \{e\}\)</li>
	<li>\(AN = G\)</li>
</ol>
Then, \(A \times N\) is isomorphic to \(G\). The isomorphism is given by
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: A \times N &amp;\rightarrow G \\
	 (a,n) &amp;\rightarrow an
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
But now the question is what happens if not all of these conditions are satisfied. Suppose that \(N\) was the only normal subgroup. In this case, \(G\) is called a semi-direct product of \(N\) and \(A\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = D_n\) where \(n \geq 3\) and \(|G| = 2n\). Let</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	N &amp;= \langle r \rangle, \ o(r) = n \\
	A &amp;= \langle j \rangle, \ o(j) = 2
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We know that \(N \cap A = \{e\}\) and \(NA = G\). We also know that \(\langle r \rangle\) is a normal subgroup while \(\langle j \rangle\) is not. Remember that \(\langle r \rangle\) is normal since if we conjugate any rotation \(r^k\) by any flip, then the result is still a rotation \(jr^kj^{-1} = r^{-k} \in N\).
<br />
<br />
So the only thing missing to be able to apply the recognition theorem is that \(A\) is not normal. Despite this, we will show that we can still construct \(G = D_n\) from the subgroups \(N\), \(A\) and third piece of information which is a homomorphism \(\gamma\). In other words, \(G\) is isomorphic to \(N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\) or \(G \cong N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\). This product \(N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\) is called the semi-direct product.
<br />
<br />
<b>What is this homomorphism \(\gamma\)</b>? \(\gamma\) will be a homomorphism from \(A\) to the group of automorphisms of \(N\). \(A\) contains two elements, \(A = \{e, j\}\). We will send each element to an automorphism from the set \(\text{Aut}(N) = \text{Aut}(\langle r \rangle)\). Specifically</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\
	\gamma: \langle j \rangle &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\langle r \rangle) \\
	e &amp;\rightarrow id \\
	j &amp;\rightarrow \gamma_j, \quad \gamma_j(r^k) = r^{-k}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So the idea here is that we will be able to reconstruct the Dihedral group from this information.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Construction of Semi-direct Products</b></h4>
<p>We haven’t said anything yet about how to actually construct \(G\) from the groups \(A\), \(N\) and \(\gamma\). The following will demonstrate this. (Important to note here that unlike the previous example, we don’t need \(A\) and \(N\) to be subgroups of \(G\). They are just groups!!!).
<br />
We will first demonstrate what happens when \(\gamma\) and \(\gamma_a\) are homomorphisms.
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Semi-direct Product Construction
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(A\) and \(N\) be groups and let
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\
	         a &amp;\rightarrow \gamma_a
	\end{align*}
	$$
be a homomorphism. Note here that not only \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism but also each \(\gamma_a\) is a homomorphism as well. Because of this we will get
<ol>
	<li>\(\gamma_a(n_1n_2) = \gamma_a(n_1) \cdot \gamma_a(n_2)\) for \(a \in A, n_1, n_2 \in N\).</li>
	<li>\(\gamma_{a_1a_2}(n) = \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n))\) for \(a_1, a_2 \in A, n \in N\).</li>
	<li>\(\gamma_{e} = id, \gamma_{a^{-1}} = (\gamma_a)^{-1}\).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
So now we will use these facts to state the semi-direct product definition.
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Semi-direct Product
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Use the construction above, we will get the group
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 G = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A
	\end{align*}
	$$
where the the product set is
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 G = N \times A = \{(n,a), n \in N, a \in A\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
The operation is
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(n_1, a_1) \cdot (n_2, a_2) = (n_1 \cdot \gamma_{a_1}(n_2), a_1a_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
where \(n_1, n_2 \in N\) and \(a_1, a_2 \in A\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Note also that \(N \cong N' \leq G\) so \(N\) is isomorphic to some subgroup of \(G\). \(A\) is also isomorphic to some subgroup to \(A' \leq G\). 
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br />
<br />
Also note that if this was a direct product, then the operation is \((n_1,a_1) \cdot (n_2,a_2) = (n_1n_2, a_1a_2)\) but here we have this application of \(\gamma_{a_1}\) on \(n_2\).
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We will show that \(G\) is a group by verifying the group properties.</p>
<ol>
    <!------------------------ASSOCIATIVITY--------------------------->
	<li>\(G\) is associative. The left hand side is
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	((n_1,a_1) \cdot (n_2,a_2)) \cdot (n_3,a_3) &amp;= (n_1 \gamma_{a_1}(n_2),a_1a_2) \cdot (n_3,a_3) \\
	                                            &amp;= (n_1 \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1a_2}(n_3),a_1a_2a_3).
													\end{align*}
	$$
</div>	
while the right hand side is
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(n_1,a_1) \cdot ((n_2,a_2) \cdot (n_3,a_3)) &amp;= (n_1,a_1) (n_1 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3),a_2a_3) \\
	                                            &amp;= (n_1, \gamma_{a_1}(n_2 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3)),  a_1a_2a_3).
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>	
	Recall the identities from the construction. Specifically, we saw that \(\gamma_a(n_1n_2) = \gamma_a(n_1) \cdot \gamma_a(n_2)\) and \(\gamma_{a_1a_2}(n) = \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n))\). Using this we see that term from the right hand side will equal to
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    \gamma_{a_1}(n_2 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3)) &amp;= \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n_3)) \\
		                                    &amp;= \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1a_2}(n_3)
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
which is the same as the term in the left hand side.
	</li>
    <!------------------------IDENTITIY--------------------------->
	<li>The identity element is \((e_N, e_A)\) (Exercise).</li>
    <!------------------------INVERSE--------------------------->
	<li>The inverse is \((n,a)^{-1} = (\gamma_{a^{-1}}(n^{-1}), a^{-1})\).</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<p>Let’s start with the trivial example. Let \(N\) and \(A\) be any groups. Define the trivial homomorphism as</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    \gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\
		                \gamma_{a} &amp;= id \quad \forall a \in A
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>This is a constant function that’s always a homomorphism no matter what the source and targets are. Basically send any element to the identity function. Then</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    N \rtimes_{\gamma} A = N \times A
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>To see this, apply the operation and you’ll see that \((a_1, a_2)(n_1, n_2) = (n_1 id(n_2), a_1a_2) = (n_1n_2, a_1a_2)\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<p>Let \(N = (\mathbf{Z}_n, +)\) where \(n \geq 3\) and let \(A = \mathbf{Z}_2 = \{[0]_2, [1]_2\}\). 
<br />
Define \(\gamma\) be</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_2 &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n)
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>We’ve seen before that \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n)\) is the modular units (mod n) group. How can we construct a homomorphism? We know that \(\mathbf{Z} = \{[0]_2, [1]_2\}\). We know we have to send \([0]_2\) to the identity element \([1]_n\). For \([1]_2\), we need to send it to an element of \(\Phi(n)\) of order 2. As an example, observe that \([-1]_n\) is of order 2 because \((-1)^2 = 1\). So</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_2 &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n) \\
		                 [0]_2  &amp;\rightarrow [1]_n \\
						 [1]_2	&amp;\rightarrow [-1]_n.
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>So we can now form a semi-direct product. Let \(G = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\). This is a group of order \(2n\). In fact, it’s isomorphic to the dihedral group \(D_n\). To see this, observe that we can replace \(N\) with \(N = \langle r \rangle\) and replace \(A\) with \(A = \langle j \rangle\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	N &amp;= \langle r \rangle, \ o(r) = n \\
	A &amp;= \langle j \rangle, \ o(j) = 2
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We can set \(\gamma\) like we did before. So</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\gamma: \langle j \rangle &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\langle r \rangle) \\
	\gamma_e &amp;\rightarrow id \\
	\gamma_j &amp;\rightarrow ((r^k) = r^{-k}) \quad \text{(send $r^k$ to its inverse))}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Remark: If you have other elements of order 2 in \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n)\), then you can form “semi-dihedral groups”. For example, take \(N = \mathbf{Z}_8\), then Aut\((N) = \Phi(8) = \{1,3,5,7\}\). All the elements in this group is of order 2 except for 1. Therefore we can define</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    \gamma' : A=\langle j \rangle &amp;\rightarrow Aut(N) \cong \Phi(8) \\
		                           j   &amp;\rightarrow 3 \quad \text{ (instead of -1 like before)}
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>So now we’ll get a different semi-direct product. We’ll get \(G' = N \rtimes_{\gamma'} A\). \(|G'| = 16\). It is not isomorphic to \(D_8\). Also \(o(r) = 8\) and \(o(j) = 2\). But we have this new formula \(jr = r^3j\). (Instead of \(jr = jr^{-1})\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Recognition Theorem for Semi-direct Product</b></h4>
<p>So now we can state the Recognition Theorem but for Semi-direct Product.
<br /></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem (Recognition Theorem)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(A, N \leq G\) be two subgroups. If
<ol>
	<li>\(N\) is a normal subgroups of \(G\).</li>
	<li>\(A \cap N = \{e\}\)</li>
	<li>\(NA = G\)</li>

Define \(\gamma\) as the homomorphism such that
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(G) \\
	 y_a(n) &amp;\rightarrow ana^{-1} \quad a \in A, a^{-1} \in N

	$$
Then, \(A \rtimes_{\gamma} N\) is isomorphic to \(G\). The isomorphism is given by
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		\gamma: A \rtimes_{\gamma} N &amp;\rightarrow G \\
		 (a,n) &amp;\rightarrow an
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
The idea of the proof is as follows. We are given that \(NA = G\). So we can write every element in \(G\) is a product of an element from \(N\) and an element from \(A\). Because we also have \(N \cap A = \{e\}\), then there is a unique way to write all of these products (proof?). So every \(g \in G\) can be written uniquely as a product \(g = na\) where \(n \in N\) and \(a \in A\). Now, take two different elements \(g_1 = n_1a_1\) and \(g_2 = n_2a_2\) where \(a_1,a_2 \in A\) and \(n_1n_2 \in N\). Multiply them</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		g_1g_2 &amp;= (n_1a_1)(n_2a_2)
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>But we also know that \(g_1g_2 \in G\) so it can also be written uniquely as a product \(g_1g_2 = na\) where \(n \in N\) and \(a \in A\). So we want to solve the equation \((n_1a_1)(n_2a_2) = na\) to get an expression that looks like \(na\). The trick is as follows</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		(n_1a_1)(n_2a_2) &amp;= n_1a_1n_2(a_1^{-1}a_1)a_2 \\
		                 &amp;= (n_1)(a_1n_2a_1^{-1})(a_1a_2)
		\end{align*}
		$$
	where
</div>
<p>\(n_1 \in N\), \(a_1n_2a_1^{-1} \in N\). \(a_1a_2 \in A\). So we can write \(n = n_1a_1n_2a_1^{-1}\) and \(a = a_1a_2\). But \(a_1n_2a_1^{-1}\) is just \(\gamma_{a_1}(n_2)\). This is exactly the product. we defined.

<p>So we’re to construct a group by a semi direct group. Set</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		N &amp;= \langle r \rangle \cong (\mathbf{Z}, +), \quad o(r)=\infty \\

		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>There are two automorphisms of \(N\). The identity function. The other automorphism is the inverse function (\(inv(r^k) = r^{-k}\)). Intuitively, \(r\) has to go to another generator that can generate the group. So it can go to itself or its inverse. So now the infinite is defined to be the semi direct product of \(N\) and \(A\) so</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		D_{\infty} = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>Note here that \(N\) is a subgroup of \(D_{\infty}\). Send \(r^k \in N\) to</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		r^{k} \rightarrow (r^k, e)
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>And \(A\) is a subgroup of \(D_{\infty}\) so send \(j^l\) to</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		j^{l} \rightarrow (j^l, e)
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>In fact \(D_{\infty} = \langle r, j \rangle\) with \(o(r) = \infty\) and \(o(j) = 2\). Also see that \(jrj^{-1} = r^{-1} \leftrightarrow jr = r^{-1}j\)
<br />

Note here that this is NOT the same as the symmetries of the disk group. The symmetries of the disk is an uncountable group. Here we have integer powers of \(r\) while the symmetries of the disk can have any power, can rotate the disk by angle.

As a reminder Theorem (Recognition Theorem) Let \(G\) be a group and \(A, N \leq G\). If \(A\) and \(N\) are normal subgroups of \(G\). \(A \cap N = \{e\}\) \(AN = G\) Then, \(A \times N\) is isomorphic to \(G\). The isomorphism is given by $$ \begin{align*} \phi: A \times N &amp;\rightarrow G \\ (a,n) &amp;\rightarrow an \end{align*} $$ But now the question is what happens if not all of these conditions are satisfied. Suppose that \(N\) was the only normal subgroup. In this case, \(G\) is called a semi-direct product of \(N\) and \(A\). Example Let \(G = D_n\) where \(n \geq 3\) and \(|G| = 2n\). Let $$ \begin{align*} N &amp;= \langle r \rangle, \ o(r) = n \\ A &amp;= \langle j \rangle, \ o(j) = 2 \end{align*} $$ We know that \(N \cap A = \{e\}\) and \(NA = G\). We also know that \(\langle r \rangle\) is a normal subgroup while \(\langle j \rangle\) is not. Remember that \(\langle r \rangle\) is normal since if we conjugate any rotation \(r^k\) by any flip, then the result is still a rotation \(jr^kj^{-1} = r^{-k} \in N\). So the only thing missing to be able to apply the recognition theorem is that \(A\) is not normal. Despite this, we will show that we can still construct \(G = D_n\) from the subgroups \(N\), \(A\) and third piece of information which is a homomorphism \(\gamma\). In other words, \(G\) is isomorphic to \(N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\) or \(G \cong N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\). This product \(N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\) is called the semi-direct product. What is this homomorphism \(\gamma\)? \(\gamma\) will be a homomorphism from \(A\) to the group of automorphisms of \(N\). \(A\) contains two elements, \(A = \{e, j\}\). We will send each element to an automorphism from the set \(\text{Aut}(N) = \text{Aut}(\langle r \rangle)\). Specifically $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\ \gamma: \langle j \rangle &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\langle r \rangle) \\ e &amp;\rightarrow id \\ j &amp;\rightarrow \gamma_j, \quad \gamma_j(r^k) = r^{-k} \end{align*} $$ So the idea here is that we will be able to reconstruct the Dihedral group from this information. Construction of Semi-direct Products We haven’t said anything yet about how to actually construct \(G\) from the groups \(A\), \(N\) and \(\gamma\). The following will demonstrate this. (Important to note here that unlike the previous example, we don’t need \(A\) and \(N\) to be subgroups of \(G\). They are just groups!!!). We will first demonstrate what happens when \(\gamma\) and \(\gamma_a\) are homomorphisms. Semi-direct Product Construction Let \(A\) and \(N\) be groups and let $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\ a &amp;\rightarrow \gamma_a \end{align*} $$ be a homomorphism. Note here that not only \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism but also each \(\gamma_a\) is a homomorphism as well. Because of this we will get \(\gamma_a(n_1n_2) = \gamma_a(n_1) \cdot \gamma_a(n_2)\) for \(a \in A, n_1, n_2 \in N\). \(\gamma_{a_1a_2}(n) = \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n))\) for \(a_1, a_2 \in A, n \in N\). \(\gamma_{e} = id, \gamma_{a^{-1}} = (\gamma_a)^{-1}\). So now we will use these facts to state the semi-direct product definition. Semi-direct Product Use the construction above, we will get the group $$ \begin{align*} G = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A \end{align*} $$ where the the product set is $$ \begin{align*} G = N \times A = \{(n,a), n \in N, a \in A\} \end{align*} $$ The operation is $$ \begin{align*} (n_1, a_1) \cdot (n_2, a_2) = (n_1 \cdot \gamma_{a_1}(n_2), a_1a_2) \end{align*} $$ where \(n_1, n_2 \in N\) and \(a_1, a_2 \in A\). Note also that \(N \cong N' \leq G\) so \(N\) is isomorphic to some subgroup of \(G\). \(A\) is also isomorphic to some subgroup to \(A' \leq G\). Also note that if this was a direct product, then the operation is \((n_1,a_1) \cdot (n_2,a_2) = (n_1n_2, a_1a_2)\) but here we have this application of \(\gamma_{a_1}\) on \(n_2\). Proof We will show that \(G\) is a group by verifying the group properties. \(G\) is associative. The left hand side is $$ \begin{align*} ((n_1,a_1) \cdot (n_2,a_2)) \cdot (n_3,a_3) &amp;= (n_1 \gamma_{a_1}(n_2),a_1a_2) \cdot (n_3,a_3) \\ &amp;= (n_1 \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1a_2}(n_3),a_1a_2a_3). \end{align*} $$ while the right hand side is $$ \begin{align*} (n_1,a_1) \cdot ((n_2,a_2) \cdot (n_3,a_3)) &amp;= (n_1,a_1) (n_1 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3),a_2a_3) \\ &amp;= (n_1, \gamma_{a_1}(n_2 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3)), a_1a_2a_3). \end{align*} $$ Recall the identities from the construction. Specifically, we saw that \(\gamma_a(n_1n_2) = \gamma_a(n_1) \cdot \gamma_a(n_2)\) and \(\gamma_{a_1a_2}(n) = \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n))\). Using this we see that term from the right hand side will equal to $$ \begin{align*} \gamma_{a_1}(n_2 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3)) &amp;= \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n_3)) \\ &amp;= \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1a_2}(n_3) \end{align*} $$ which is the same as the term in the left hand side. The identity element is \((e_N, e_A)\) (Exercise). The inverse is \((n,a)^{-1} = (\gamma_{a^{-1}}(n^{-1}), a^{-1})\). Example 1 Let’s start with the trivial example. Let \(N\) and \(A\) be any groups. Define the trivial homomorphism as $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\ \gamma_{a} &amp;= id \quad \forall a \in A \end{align*} $$ This is a constant function that’s always a homomorphism no matter what the source and targets are. Basically send any element to the identity function. Then $$ \begin{align*} N \rtimes_{\gamma} A = N \times A \end{align*} $$ To see this, apply the operation and you’ll see that \((a_1, a_2)(n_1, n_2) = (n_1 id(n_2), a_1a_2) = (n_1n_2, a_1a_2)\). Example 2 Let \(N = (\mathbf{Z}_n, +)\) where \(n \geq 3\) and let \(A = \mathbf{Z}_2 = \{[0]_2, [1]_2\}\). Define \(\gamma\) be $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_2 &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n) \end{align*} $$ We’ve seen before that \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n)\) is the modular units (mod n) group. How can we construct a homomorphism? We know that \(\mathbf{Z} = \{[0]_2, [1]_2\}\). We know we have to send \([0]_2\) to the identity element \([1]_n\). For \([1]_2\), we need to send it to an element of \(\Phi(n)\) of order 2. As an example, observe that \([-1]_n\) is of order 2 because \((-1)^2 = 1\). So $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_2 &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n) \\ [0]_2 &amp;\rightarrow [1]_n \\ [1]_2 &amp;\rightarrow [-1]_n. \end{align*} $$ So we can now form a semi-direct product. Let \(G = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\). This is a group of order \(2n\). In fact, it’s isomorphic to the dihedral group \(D_n\). To see this, observe that we can replace \(N\) with \(N = \langle r \rangle\) and replace \(A\) with \(A = \langle j \rangle\). $$ \begin{align*} N &amp;= \langle r \rangle, \ o(r) = n \\ A &amp;= \langle j \rangle, \ o(j) = 2 \end{align*} $$ We can set \(\gamma\) like we did before. So $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: \langle j \rangle &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\langle r \rangle) \\ \gamma_e &amp;\rightarrow id \\ \gamma_j &amp;\rightarrow ((r^k) = r^{-k}) \quad \text{(send $r^k$ to its inverse))} \end{align*} $$ Remark: If you have other elements of order 2 in \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n)\), then you can form “semi-dihedral groups”. For example, take \(N = \mathbf{Z}_8\), then Aut\((N) = \Phi(8) = \{1,3,5,7\}\). All the elements in this group is of order 2 except for 1. Therefore we can define $$ \begin{align*} \gamma' : A=\langle j \rangle &amp;\rightarrow Aut(N) \cong \Phi(8) \\ j &amp;\rightarrow 3 \quad \text{ (instead of -1 like before)} \end{align*} $$ So now we’ll get a different semi-direct product. We’ll get \(G' = N \rtimes_{\gamma'} A\). \(|G'| = 16\). It is not isomorphic to \(D_8\). Also \(o(r) = 8\) and \(o(j) = 2\). But we have this new formula \(jr = r^3j\). (Instead of \(jr = jr^{-1})\). Recognition Theorem for Semi-direct Product So now we can state the Recognition Theorem but for Semi-direct Product. Theorem (Recognition Theorem) Let \(G\) be a group and let \(A, N \leq G\) be two subgroups. If \(N\) is a normal subgroups of \(G\). \(A \cap N = \{e\}\) \(NA = G\) Define \(\gamma\) as the homomorphism such that $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(G) \\ y_a(n) &amp;\rightarrow ana^{-1} \quad a \in A, a^{-1} \in N \end{align*} $$ Then, \(A \rtimes_{\gamma} N\) is isomorphic to \(G\). The isomorphism is given by $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: A \rtimes_{\gamma} N &amp;\rightarrow G \\ (a,n) &amp;\rightarrow an \end{align*} $$ Proof The idea of the proof is as follows. We are given that \(NA = G\). So we can write every element in \(G\) is a product of an element from \(N\) and an element from \(A\). Because we also have \(N \cap A = \{e\}\), then there is a unique way to write all of these products (proof?). So every \(g \in G\) can be written uniquely as a product \(g = na\) where \(n \in N\) and \(a \in A\). Now, take two different elements \(g_1 = n_1a_1\) and \(g_2 = n_2a_2\) where \(a_1,a_2 \in A\) and \(n_1n_2 \in N\). Multiply them $$ \begin{align*} g_1g_2 &amp;= (n_1a_1)(n_2a_2) \end{align*} $$ But we also know that \(g_1g_2 \in G\) so it can also be written uniquely as a product \(g_1g_2 = na\) where \(n \in N\) and \(a \in A\). So we want to solve the equation \((n_1a_1)(n_2a_2) = na\) to get an expression that looks like \(na\). The trick is as follows $$ \begin{align*} (n_1a_1)(n_2a_2) &amp;= n_1a_1n_2(a_1^{-1}a_1)a_2 \\ &amp;= (n_1)(a_1n_2a_1^{-1})(a_1a_2) \end{align*} $$ where \(n_1 \in N\), \(a_1n_2a_1^{-1} \in N\). \(a_1a_2 \in A\). So we can write \(n = n_1a_1n_2a_1^{-1}\) and \(a = a_1a_2\). But \(a_1n_2a_1^{-1}\) is just \(\gamma_{a_1}(n_2)\). This is exactly the product. we defined. Infinite Dihedral Group So we’re to construct a group by a semi direct group. Set $$ \begin{align*} N &amp;= \langle r \rangle \cong (\mathbf{Z}, +), \quad o(r)=\infty \\ A &amp;= \langle j \rangle \cong (\mathbf{Z}_2, +), \quad o(j)=2 \end{align*} $$ Define the homomorphism $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: A \rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \cong \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}) = \{\pm 1\}, \quad o(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}) = 2) \end{align*} $$ There are two automorphisms of \(N\). The identity function. The other automorphism is the inverse function (\(inv(r^k) = r^{-k}\)). Intuitively, \(r\) has to go to another generator that can generate the group. So it can go to itself or its inverse. So now the infinite is defined to be the semi direct product of \(N\) and \(A\) so $$ \begin{align*} D_{\infty} = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A \end{align*} $$ Note here that \(N\) is a subgroup of \(D_{\infty}\). Send \(r^k \in N\) to $$ \begin{align*} r^{k} \rightarrow (r^k, e) \end{align*} $$ And \(A\) is a subgroup of \(D_{\infty}\) so send \(j^l\) to $$ \begin{align*} j^{l} \rightarrow (j^l, e) \end{align*} $$ In fact \(D_{\infty} = \langle r, j \rangle\) with \(o(r) = \infty\) and \(o(j) = 2\). Also see that \(jrj^{-1} = r^{-1} \leftrightarrow jr = r^{-1}j\) Note here that this is NOT the same as the symmetries of the disk group. The symmetries of the disk is an uncountable group. Here we have integer powers of \(r\) while the symmetries of the disk can have any power, can rotate the disk by angle.

Definition: Direct Products

<div class="mintbodydiv">
Suppose \(A\) and \(B\) are groups. Then the Direct Product:
$$
\begin{align*}
G = A \times B = \{(a,b) \ | \ a \in A, b \in B\}
\end{align*}
$$

is a group. The identity element \(e_{A \times B} = (a_G, b_H)\) and the inverse of \((a,b)\) is \((a^{-1},b^{-1})\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Observation: \(A' = \{(a,e_{b}) \ | \ a \in A \}\) and \(B' = \{(e_a,b) \ | \ b \in B \}\) are subgroups of \(G\). Moreover, \(A'\) is isomorphic to \(A\) and \(B'\) is isomorphic to \(B\). We also note that</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(A'\) and \(B'\) are normal subgroups of \(G\). To see this, observe that for \((a, e) \in A'\) and \((x, y) \in G\)</li>

	<li>\(A'B' = \{xy \ | \ x \in A', y \in B'\} = G\)</li>

<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem (Recognition Theorem)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and \(A, B \leq G\). If
<ol>
	<li>\(A\) and \(B\) are normal subgroups of \(G\).</li>
	<li>\(A \cap B = \{e\}\)</li>
	<li>\(AB = G\)</li>
</ol>
Then, \(A \times B\) is isomorphic to \(G\). The isomorphism is given by
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: A \times B &amp;\rightarrow G \\
	 (a,b) &amp;\rightarrow ab
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We need to show that \(\phi\) is a homomorphism and that it is surjective and injective. 
<br />
<br />
Claim: If \(a \in A, b \in B\), then \(ab = ba\). Note that this doesn’t say anything about whether \(G\), \(A\) or \(B\) are abelian. 
<br />
Proof: To see this, observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e \implies ab = ba
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is because we can just multiply by each element’s inverse on both sides. Now observe that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = (aba^{-1})b^{-1}\). We know that \(B\) is normal so \(aba^{-1} \in B\). \(b^{-1}\) is also in \(B\) since \(B\) is a subgroup. Therefore, \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in B\). Similarly, observe that that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = a(ba^{-1}b^{-1})\). \(A\) is normal so \(ba^{-1}b^{-1}\) is in \(A\). So \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A\). So now we have \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A\) and \(aba^{-1}b^{-1}\). This means that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A \cap B\). But \(A \cap B = \{e\}\) so \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e\) and therefore \(ab = ba\).
<br />
<br />
Now, to show that \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism, we want to show that \(\varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot (a_2,b_2)) = \varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot \varphi(a_2,b_2)\). The left hand side is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot (a_2,b_2)) = \varphi((a_1a_2, b_1b_2)) = a_1a_2b_1b_2.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>while the right hand side is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot \varphi(a_2,b_2) &amp;= a_1b_1 \cdot a_2b_2 \\
	                                        &amp;= a_1(b_1a_2)b_2 \\
											&amp;= a_1(a_2b_1)b_2 \quad \text{(by the claim we proved)} \\
											&amp;= a_1a_2b_1b_2.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. Next, we show that \(\varphi\) is surjective. But this is true by property (3) since \(AB = G\). Finally, we want to show that \(\varphi\) is injective. This is equivalent to showing that \(\ker(\varphi) = \{e\}\). By definition,</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(\varphi) = \{ (a,b) \in G \ | \ \varphi((a,b)) = ab = e \}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So we need all the products such that \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\) where \((a,b)=(e,e)\). So suppose \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\) and \(ab = e\). The trick here is to move everything to the other side so that \(a = b^{-1}\). Here, \(a \in A\) and \(b^{-1} \in B\). But \(A \cap B = \{e\}\). So \(a = b = e\). So \(\ker(\varphi) = \{(e,e)\}\). From this we see that it is an isomorphism as we wanted to show.

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_{12}\). Let \(A = \langle [3] \rangle = \{[0],[3],[6],[9]\}\). Let \(B = \langle [3] \rangle = \{[0],[4],[8]\}\) Both \(A\) and \(B\) are subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}_{12}\). Check all three properties</p>
<ul>
	<li>Are they normal? Yes because \(A\) and \(B\) are abelian since \(\mathbf{Z}_{12}\) is abelian.</li>
	<li>\(A \cap B = \{[0]\}\) since we listed the elements above.</li>
	<li>The product subset is \(A+B = \{x+y \in A, y \in B\} = G\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note here that we already know that \(\mathbf{Z}_3 \times \mathbf{Z}_4 \cong \mathbf{Z}_{12}\) by the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
<br />
<br /></p>

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Automorphism of a group \(G\)</b></h4>
<p>An Automorphism of a group \(G\) is just an isomorphism from the group to itself. The identity map is the easiest example of an automorphism but there can be others.
<br />
<br />
Example: Let \(V = \{e, a, b, c\}\) (The Klien 4-group)(\(\cong \mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_2)\). We know that \(a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e\). The products are</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	ab &amp;= ba = c \\
	ac &amp;= ca = b \\
	bc &amp;= cb = a
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Now define \(\varphi: V \rightarrow V\) such that \(\varphi(e) = e\), \(\varphi(a) = b\), \(\varphi(b) = b\), \(\varphi(c)=a\). \(\varphi\) is an automorphism. This is because</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(\varphi\) is both injective and surjective so it is a bijection.</li>
	<li>\(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. We can check that \(\varphi(xy) = \varphi(x)\varphi(y)\)</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, there are six automorphisms of \(V\). Note here that the six automorphisms are basically permutations on the set of elements. There are exactly 24 permutations on a set of 4 elements. But we also need to satisfy the homomorphism condition. This means that for example, it will need to send the identity element to the identity element. So now how many permutations are available if the identity element is fixed? There are 6 permutations. In this example, this is also the answer to the number of automorphisms. 
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
The collection of automorphisms is called \(\text{Aut}(G) = \{\varphi: G \rightarrow G \ | \ \varphi \text{ is an  automorphism}\}\). This is a subgroup of the permutation group \(Sym(G)\) as we saw. Also note here that since Aut\((G)\) is a subgroup, then \(|\text{Aut}(G)|\) must divide \(G\) if \(G\) is finite. 
<br />
<br />
For example, we can see using the example above that Aut\((V)\) is isomorphic to \(S_3\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_n\) where \(n \geq 1\). Does this group have automorphisms other than the identity? <br />
For example, let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_{15}\). Define the following function</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi: \mathbf{Z}_{15} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_{15} \\
	            \varphi([x]) &amp;= [2x] = [2][x].
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The claim is that \(\varphi\) is an automorphism. It is a homomorphism because</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi([x]+[y]) &amp;= \varphi([2]([x]+[y])) \\
	                 &amp;= \varphi([2][x]+[2][y]) \\
	                 &amp;= \varphi([x]) + \varphi([y]).
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>It is also a bijection. Note that we’re multiplying by \([2]\). In \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\) (mod 15), \([2]\) has a multiplicate inverse since 2 and 15 are relatively prime. In fact, its multiplicative inverse is \([8]\) because \([2][8] = [16\%15] = [1]\). Therefore, to get the inverse, we just need to multiply by \([8]\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi^{-1}([y]) = [8][y].
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Therefore, \(\varphi\) is a bijection. Thus, it is an automorphism. In fact, this generalizes to \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). Every modular unit mod n gives us an automorphism for \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). This is captured in the following proposition
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
\(\text{Aut}(G) \cong \Phi(n)\). The automorphism is given by
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	[a] &amp;\rightarrow \gamma(a) \\
	\gamma_{[a]}([x]) &amp;= [ax]
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p><br />
Note here that \(\gamma(a)\) is a function. The isomorphism is between a group of functions and the modular unit \(a\). 
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Suppose \(\varphi \in \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n)\). Let \([a] = \varphi([1])\). Then we can show that \(\varphi([x]) = [ax]\). 
<br />
<br />

Example: What about \(\mathbf{Z}\)? What are the automorphism? Aut\((\mathbf{Z}) = \{\pm 1\}\)

<h4><b>More Automorphisms</b></h4>
<p>Some more definitions:
<br /></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition (The "conjugation by \(g\)" function)
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Given \(g \in G\), define \(c_g: G \rightarrow G\) by \(c_g(x) = gxg^{-1}\)
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Some facts about this function:</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(c_g \in \text{Aut}(G)\). So \(c_g\) is an automorphism and it has an inverse \(c^{-1}_g\). Furthermore, if \(G\) is abelian, then \(c_g = id\) because \(gxg^{-1}\) will reduce to just \(x\) when \(G\) is abelian</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also define the function</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	c: G &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(G) \\
	g &amp;\rightarrow c_g
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This function is a homomorphism. What does this mean? It means that conjugating by a product \(ab\) is the same as conjugating by \(a\) and then by \(b\). \(c_{ab} = c_a \circ c_b\).
<br />
<br />
Since it’s a homomorphism, we can check its kernel. It’s kernel is as follows</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(c) = \mathbf{Z}(G)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Which is called the center of “G”.
<br />
<br />
Additionally, we have the subgroup \(c(G)\) which is the image of \(G\) under \(c\). \(c(G)\) is a subgroup of Aut\((G)\). This subgroup is usually called \(Inn(G)\) (subgroup of inner automorphism). Fact: Inn\((G)\) is a normal subgroup of Aut\((G)\).
<br />
<br />
Since Inn\((G)\) is normal, we can then form the quotient group Out\((G) = \text{Aut}/\text{Inn}(G)\). This group is called the outer automorphism.

Restating this Definition: Direct Products Suppose \(A\) and \(B\) are groups. Then the Direct Product: $$ \begin{align*} G = A \times B = \{(a,b) \ | \ a \in A, b \in B\} \end{align*} $$ With Operation: $$ \begin{align*} (a_1, b_1) \cdot (a_2, b_2) = (a_1a_2, b_1b_2) \end{align*} $$ is a group. The identity element \(e_{A \times B} = (a_G, b_H)\) and the inverse of \((a,b)\) is \((a^{-1},b^{-1})\). Observation: \(A' = \{(a,e_{b}) \ | \ a \in A \}\) and \(B' = \{(e_a,b) \ | \ b \in B \}\) are subgroups of \(G\). Moreover, \(A'\) is isomorphic to \(A\) and \(B'\) is isomorphic to \(B\). We also note that \(A'\) and \(B'\) are normal subgroups of \(G\). To see this, observe that for \((a, e) \in A'\) and \((x, y) \in G\) $$ \begin{align*} (x, y)(a, e)(x, y)^{-1} = (xax^{-1}, yey^{-1}) = (xax^{-1}, e) \in A' \end{align*} $$ \(A' \cap B' = \{e_A, e_B\}\) \(A'B' = \{xy \ | \ x \in A', y \in B'\} = G\) From this, we have the following proposition Theorem (Recognition Theorem) Let \(G\) be a group and \(A, B \leq G\). If \(A\) and \(B\) are normal subgroups of \(G\). \(A \cap B = \{e\}\) \(AB = G\) Then, \(A \times B\) is isomorphic to \(G\). The isomorphism is given by $$ \begin{align*} \phi: A \times B &amp;\rightarrow G \\ (a,b) &amp;\rightarrow ab \end{align*} $$ Proof We need to show that \(\phi\) is a homomorphism and that it is surjective and injective. Claim: If \(a \in A, b \in B\), then \(ab = ba\). Note that this doesn’t say anything about whether \(G\), \(A\) or \(B\) are abelian. Proof: To see this, observe that $$ \begin{align*} aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e \implies ab = ba \end{align*} $$ This is because we can just multiply by each element’s inverse on both sides. Now observe that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = (aba^{-1})b^{-1}\). We know that \(B\) is normal so \(aba^{-1} \in B\). \(b^{-1}\) is also in \(B\) since \(B\) is a subgroup. Therefore, \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in B\). Similarly, observe that that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = a(ba^{-1}b^{-1})\). \(A\) is normal so \(ba^{-1}b^{-1}\) is in \(A\). So \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A\). So now we have \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A\) and \(aba^{-1}b^{-1}\). This means that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A \cap B\). But \(A \cap B = \{e\}\) so \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e\) and therefore \(ab = ba\). Now, to show that \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism, we want to show that \(\varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot (a_2,b_2)) = \varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot \varphi(a_2,b_2)\). The left hand side is $$ \begin{align*} \varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot (a_2,b_2)) = \varphi((a_1a_2, b_1b_2)) = a_1a_2b_1b_2. \end{align*} $$ while the right hand side is $$ \begin{align*} \varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot \varphi(a_2,b_2) &amp;= a_1b_1 \cdot a_2b_2 \\ &amp;= a_1(b_1a_2)b_2 \\ &amp;= a_1(a_2b_1)b_2 \quad \text{(by the claim we proved)} \\ &amp;= a_1a_2b_1b_2. \end{align*} $$ So \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. Next, we show that \(\varphi\) is surjective. But this is true by property (3) since \(AB = G\). Finally, we want to show that \(\varphi\) is injective. This is equivalent to showing that \(\ker(\varphi) = \{e\}\). By definition, $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\varphi) = \{ (a,b) \in G \ | \ \varphi((a,b)) = ab = e \} \end{align*} $$ So we need all the products such that \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\) where \((a,b)=(e,e)\). So suppose \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\) and \(ab = e\). The trick here is to move everything to the other side so that \(a = b^{-1}\). Here, \(a \in A\) and \(b^{-1} \in B\). But \(A \cap B = \{e\}\). So \(a = b = e\). So \(\ker(\varphi) = \{(e,e)\}\). From this we see that it is an isomorphism as we wanted to show. Example Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_{12}\). Let \(A = \langle [3] \rangle = \{[0],[3],[6],[9]\}\). Let \(B = \langle [3] \rangle = \{[0],[4],[8]\}\) Both \(A\) and \(B\) are subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}_{12}\). Check all three properties Are they normal? Yes because \(A\) and \(B\) are abelian since \(\mathbf{Z}_{12}\) is abelian. \(A \cap B = \{[0]\}\) since we listed the elements above. The product subset is \(A+B = \{x+y \in A, y \in B\} = G\) Note here that we already know that \(\mathbf{Z}_3 \times \mathbf{Z}_4 \cong \mathbf{Z}_{12}\) by the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Automorphism of a group \(G\) An Automorphism of a group \(G\) is just an isomorphism from the group to itself. The identity map is the easiest example of an automorphism but there can be others. Example: Let \(V = \{e, a, b, c\}\) (The Klien 4-group)(\(\cong \mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_2)\). We know that \(a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e\). The products are $$ \begin{align*} ab &amp;= ba = c \\ ac &amp;= ca = b \\ bc &amp;= cb = a \end{align*} $$ Now define \(\varphi: V \rightarrow V\) such that \(\varphi(e) = e\), \(\varphi(a) = b\), \(\varphi(b) = b\), \(\varphi(c)=a\). \(\varphi\) is an automorphism. This is because \(\varphi\) is both injective and surjective so it is a bijection. \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. We can check that \(\varphi(xy) = \varphi(x)\varphi(y)\) In fact, there are six automorphisms of \(V\). Note here that the six automorphisms are basically permutations on the set of elements. There are exactly 24 permutations on a set of 4 elements. But we also need to satisfy the homomorphism condition. This means that for example, it will need to send the identity element to the identity element. So now how many permutations are available if the identity element is fixed? There are 6 permutations. In this example, this is also the answer to the number of automorphisms. The collection of automorphisms is called \(\text{Aut}(G) = \{\varphi: G \rightarrow G \ | \ \varphi \text{ is an automorphism}\}\). This is a subgroup of the permutation group \(Sym(G)\) as we saw. Also note here that since Aut\((G)\) is a subgroup, then \(|\text{Aut}(G)|\) must divide \(G\) if \(G\) is finite. For example, we can see using the example above that Aut\((V)\) is isomorphic to \(S_3\). Example Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_n\) where \(n \geq 1\). Does this group have automorphisms other than the identity? For example, let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_{15}\). Define the following function $$ \begin{align*} \varphi: \mathbf{Z}_{15} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_{15} \\ \varphi([x]) &amp;= [2x] = [2][x]. \end{align*} $$ The claim is that \(\varphi\) is an automorphism. It is a homomorphism because $$ \begin{align*} \varphi([x]+[y]) &amp;= \varphi([2]([x]+[y])) \\ &amp;= \varphi([2][x]+[2][y]) \\ &amp;= \varphi([x]) + \varphi([y]). \end{align*} $$ It is also a bijection. Note that we’re multiplying by \([2]\). In \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\) (mod 15), \([2]\) has a multiplicate inverse since 2 and 15 are relatively prime. In fact, its multiplicative inverse is \([8]\) because \([2][8] = [16\%15] = [1]\). Therefore, to get the inverse, we just need to multiply by \([8]\). $$ \begin{align*} \varphi^{-1}([y]) = [8][y]. \end{align*} $$ Therefore, \(\varphi\) is a bijection. Thus, it is an automorphism. In fact, this generalizes to \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). Every modular unit mod n gives us an automorphism for \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). This is captured in the following proposition Proposition \(\text{Aut}(G) \cong \Phi(n)\). The automorphism is given by $$ \begin{align*} [a] &amp;\rightarrow \gamma(a) \\ \gamma_{[a]}([x]) &amp;= [ax] \end{align*} $$ Note here that \(\gamma(a)\) is a function. The isomorphism is between a group of functions and the modular unit \(a\). Proof Suppose \(\varphi \in \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n)\). Let \([a] = \varphi([1])\). Then we can show that \(\varphi([x]) = [ax]\). Example: What about \(\mathbf{Z}\)? What are the automorphism? Aut\((\mathbf{Z}) = \{\pm 1\}\) More Automorphisms Some more definitions: Definition (The "conjugation by \(g\)" function) Given \(g \in G\), define \(c_g: G \rightarrow G\) by \(c_g(x) = gxg^{-1}\) Some facts about this function: \(c_g \in \text{Aut}(G)\). So \(c_g\) is an automorphism and it has an inverse \(c^{-1}_g\). Furthermore, if \(G\) is abelian, then \(c_g = id\) because \(gxg^{-1}\) will reduce to just \(x\) when \(G\) is abelian We can also define the function $$ \begin{align*} c: G &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(G) \\ g &amp;\rightarrow c_g \end{align*} $$ This function is a homomorphism. What does this mean? It means that conjugating by a product \(ab\) is the same as conjugating by \(a\) and then by \(b\). \(c_{ab} = c_a \circ c_b\). Since it’s a homomorphism, we can check its kernel. It’s kernel is as follows $$ \begin{align*} \ker(c) = \mathbf{Z}(G) \end{align*} $$ Which is called the center of “G”. Additionally, we have the subgroup \(c(G)\) which is the image of \(G\) under \(c\). \(c(G)\) is a subgroup of Aut\((G)\). This subgroup is usually called \(Inn(G)\) (subgroup of inner automorphism). Fact: Inn\((G)\) is a normal subgroup of Aut\((G)\). Since Inn\((G)\) is normal, we can then form the quotient group Out\((G) = \text{Aut}/\text{Inn}(G)\). This group is called the outer automorphism. References MATH417 by Charles Rezk Algebra: Abstract and Concrete by Frederick M.

<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let’s take the previous example but slightly modify it so that \(G = \langle a \rangle\) where \(o(a) = 2\) and \(H = \langle b \rangle\) with \(o(b) = 3\). So now we’re get 6 elements instead in the group</p>

\begin{align*}
G \times H = \{ (e,e), (a,e), (e,b), (a,b), (e,b^2), (a, b^2)\}

<p>This group is cyclic. It must contain an element of order 5 that generates the group. If we let \((a, b) = x\), then we’ll see that</p>

$$
\begin{align*}
(a,b) \cdot (a,b) &amp;= (e, b^2) = x^2 \\
(e, b^2) \cdot (a,b)  &amp;= (a, e) = x^3 \\
(a, e) \cdot (a,b)  &amp;= (e, b) = x^4 \\
(e, b) \cdot (a,b)  &amp;= (a, b^2) = x^5.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>At some point when we get to \(x^4\), we know by Lagrange, that the order of the element will be 6. This group is in fact isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_3 \cong \mathbf{Z}_6\).
<br />
<br />
Why was this example different? why was this one cyclic. Because 2 and 3 are prime numbers. \(a\) has order \(2\) and \(b\) is of order \(3\). To get to the identity element, we will need a power that is the least common multiple which is 6.
<br />
<br />
We can formalize this idea in the next proposition
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(a, b \geq 1\). The formula 
$$
\begin{align*}
\gamma(x) = ([x]_a, [x]_b)
\end{align*}
$$
defines a homomorphism \(\gamma: \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) such that
$$
\begin{align*}
\ker(\gamma) = \mathbf{Z}m \ \text{ (multiples of $m$ where } m=lcm(a,b)).
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
First note that \(\gamma\) is well defined. Next, we want to show that \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism. Since we’re working on \(\mathbf{Z}_a\) and \(\mathbf{Z}_b\), then we want to show that \(\gamma(x+y) = \gamma(x) + \gamma(y)\). Observe that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\gamma(x+y) &amp;= ([x+y]_a, [x+y]_b) \\
            &amp;= ([x]_a + [y]_a, [x]_b, [y]_b) \\
			&amp;= ([x]_a, [x]_b) + ([y]_a, [y]_b) \\
			&amp;= \gamma(x) + \gamma(y) \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Next, we want to show that the kernel is the set of multiples of \(m\) so \(\ker(\gamma) = \mathbf{Z}m\) where \(m = lcm(a,b)\). By definition,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\ker(\gamma) &amp;= \{x \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \gamma(x) = ([x]_a, [x]_b) = ([0]_a, [0]_b)\}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>In other words, we want \(x\) such that \(x \equiv 0 (\bmod a)\) and \(x \equiv 0 (\bmod b)\) divides \(x\). That is \(a\) divides \(x\) and \(b\) divides \(x\). This is the set of multiples of \(m\). Therefore</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\ker(\gamma) &amp;= \mathbf{Z}a \cap \mathbf{Z}b = \mathbf{Z}m.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>where \(m = lcm(a,b) = \frac{ab}{gcd(a,b)}\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>A New Homomorphism</b></h4>
<p>As a consequence of this, we will get an injective homomorphism from the quotient group \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}m\) which is \(\mathbf{Z}_m\) to \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) as follows</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{Z}_m &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b  \\
                        [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_a, [x]_b)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Why? Recall that we defined a homomorphism \(\gamma\) from \(\mathbf{Z}\) to \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\). Its kernel \(K = \mathbf{Z}m\). By the Homomorphism Theorem, we get another homomorphism from the quotient group \(\mathbf{Z}/K\) to the same target group \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\). Also recall that since \(\ker(\gamma) = K = \mathbf{Z}m\), then the new homomorphism is also injective.

<h4><b>The Multiplicative Group</b></h4>
<p>Recall \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) is not just a group but a ring with two operations addition and multiplication. Inside this ring, we can focus on the elements that have a multiplicative inverse and form \(\Phi(n) = \{u \in \mathbf{Z}_n \ |\) u has a multiplicative inverse \(\} \subseteq \mathbf{Z}_n\). \((\Phi(n),\cdot)\) is a group with the multiplication operation. This group is also abelian and is called “modular units”. It is not a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}_n\).
<br />
<br />
It turns out that we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to decompose \(\Phi(n)\), the modular units group. Before listing the theorem recall that if \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\). Then \([x]_n \in \Phi(n)\) if and only if \(gcd(x,n)=1\).

</div>
<p>which is a bijection. why?</p>
<ul>
<li>if \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\) such that \([x]_m \in \Phi(m)\), then we know that \(gcd(x,m) = 1\). We defined \(m = ab\). So if \(x\) is relatively prime to \(m\), then it must be relatively prime to the factors of \(m\), so \(gcd(x,b) = 1\). This means that \([x]_a \in \Phi(a)\) and \([x]_b \in \Phi(b)\). </li>
<li>\(\gamma'\) is injective because \(\gamma\) is an injective function.</li>
<li>\(\gamma'\) is surjective. \(\gamma\) is a bijection so every element of \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) has the form \([x]_a, [x]_b\) for some \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\). This means that \(gcd(x,a) = 1 = gcd(x, b)\). So \(gcd(x,ab) = 1\).</li>
</ul>

There are other ways to construct groups like the following Definition: Direct Products Suppose \(G\) and \(H\) are groups. Then the Direct Product: $$ \begin{align*} G \times H = \{(g,h) \ | \ g \in G, h \in H\} \end{align*} $$ With Operation: $$ \begin{align*} (g_1, h_1) \cdot (g_2, h_2) = (g_1g_2, h_1h_2) \end{align*} $$ is a group. The identity element \(e_{G \times H} = (e_G, e_H)\) and the inverse of \((g,h)\) is \((g^{-1},h^{-1})\). You can verify that this is indeed a group (Exercise). Example Let \(G = \langle a \rangle\) where \(o(a) = 2\) and \(H = \langle b \rangle\) with \(o(b) = 2\). Then $$ \begin{align*} G \times H = \{ (e,e), (a,e), (e,b), (a,b)\} \end{align*} $$ Note that this is a group. Since it has four elements then it must be isomorphic to either \(V\) ( symmetries of the rectangle) or the cyclic one (so we need an element of order 4). To classify this group, we need to find the order of each element. $$ \begin{align*} (a,b)^2 &amp;= (a,b) \cdot (a,b) = (aa, bb) = (e, e) \quad \text{(because the order of a and b is 2)} \\ (a,e)^2 &amp;= (e,e) = (e,b)^2. \end{align*} $$ From this we see that each element is of order 2 since \(G \times H\) is isomorphic to \(V\) (The Klien 4-group which is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_2\)). Properties of Direct Product Groups These are some facts about direct product groups Proposition Let \(G\) and \(H\) be groups. Then the size of \(G \times H\) is \(|G \times H| = |G||H|\). Proposition Let \(G_1 \cong G_2\) and \(H_1 \cong H_2\) be groups. Then \(G_1 \times H_1 \cong G_2 \times H_2\). Proof To show that two groups are isomorphic, we need to provide an isomorphism between the two groups. Since we know that \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) are isomorphic, then let \(\alpha : G_1 \rightarrow G_2\) be an isomorphism. Similarly, since \(H_1\) and \(H_2\) are isomorphic, then let \(\beta : H_1 \rightarrow H_2\) be an isomorphism. Then we claim that $$ \begin{align*} \gamma : G_1 \times H_1 &amp;\rightarrow H_2 \times G_2 \\ \gamma(g, h) &amp;= (\alpha(g), \beta(h)). \end{align*} $$ is an isomorphism. [TODO … verify] Generalizing Direct Products We can generalize the definition of direct products to say Definition: Generalized Direct Products Suppose \(G_1, G_2,...,G_r\) are groups. Then $$ \begin{align*} \bar{G} &amp;= G_1 \times G_2 \times .... \times G_r \\ &amp;= \{(g_1, g_2,...,g_r) \ | \ g_i \in G_i\} \end{align*} $$ With Operation: $$ \begin{align*} (g_1, g_2, ..., g_r) \cdot (g'_1,g'_2, ..., g'_r) = (g_1g'_1, g_2g'_2, ..., g_rg'_r) \end{align*} $$ is a group. Example Let’s take the previous example but slightly modify it so that \(G = \langle a \rangle\) where \(o(a) = 2\) and \(H = \langle b \rangle\) with \(o(b) = 3\). So now we’re get 6 elements instead in the group $$ \begin{align*} G \times H = \{ (e,e), (a,e), (e,b), (a,b), (e,b^2), (a, b^2)\} \end{align*} $$ This group is cyclic. It must contain an element of order 5 that generates the group. If we let \((a, b) = x\), then we’ll see that $$ \begin{align*} (a,b) \cdot (a,b) &amp;= (e, b^2) = x^2 \\ (e, b^2) \cdot (a,b) &amp;= (a, e) = x^3 \\ (a, e) \cdot (a,b) &amp;= (e, b) = x^4 \\ (e, b) \cdot (a,b) &amp;= (a, b^2) = x^5. \end{align*} $$ At some point when we get to \(x^4\), we know by Lagrange, that the order of the element will be 6. This group is in fact isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_3 \cong \mathbf{Z}_6\). Why was this example different? why was this one cyclic. Because 2 and 3 are prime numbers. \(a\) has order \(2\) and \(b\) is of order \(3\). To get to the identity element, we will need a power that is the least common multiple which is 6. We can formalize this idea in the next proposition Proposition Let \(a, b \geq 1\). The formula $$ \begin{align*} \gamma(x) = ([x]_a, [x]_b) \end{align*} $$ defines a homomorphism \(\gamma: \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) such that $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\gamma) = \mathbf{Z}m \ \text{ (multiples of $m$ where } m=lcm(a,b)). \end{align*} $$ Proof First note that \(\gamma\) is well defined. Next, we want to show that \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism. Since we’re working on \(\mathbf{Z}_a\) and \(\mathbf{Z}_b\), then we want to show that \(\gamma(x+y) = \gamma(x) + \gamma(y)\). Observe that $$ \begin{align*} \gamma(x+y) &amp;= ([x+y]_a, [x+y]_b) \\ &amp;= ([x]_a + [y]_a, [x]_b, [y]_b) \\ &amp;= ([x]_a, [x]_b) + ([y]_a, [y]_b) \\ &amp;= \gamma(x) + \gamma(y) \\ \end{align*} $$ Next, we want to show that the kernel is the set of multiples of \(m\) so \(\ker(\gamma) = \mathbf{Z}m\) where \(m = lcm(a,b)\). By definition, $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\gamma) &amp;= \{x \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \gamma(x) = ([x]_a, [x]_b) = ([0]_a, [0]_b)\}. \end{align*} $$ In other words, we want \(x\) such that \(x \equiv 0 (\bmod a)\) and \(x \equiv 0 (\bmod b)\) divides \(x\). That is \(a\) divides \(x\) and \(b\) divides \(x\). This is the set of multiples of \(m\). Therefore $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\gamma) &amp;= \mathbf{Z}a \cap \mathbf{Z}b = \mathbf{Z}m. \end{align*} $$ where \(m = lcm(a,b) = \frac{ab}{gcd(a,b)}\). A New Homomorphism As a consequence of this, we will get an injective homomorphism from the quotient group \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}m\) which is \(\mathbf{Z}_m\) to \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) as follows $$ \begin{align*} \mathbf{Z}_m &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b \\ [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_a, [x]_b) \end{align*} $$ Why? Recall that we defined a homomorphism \(\gamma\) from \(\mathbf{Z}\) to \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\). Its kernel \(K = \mathbf{Z}m\). By the Homomorphism Theorem, we get another homomorphism from the quotient group \(\mathbf{Z}/K\) to the same target group \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\). Also recall that since \(\ker(\gamma) = K = \mathbf{Z}m\), then the new homomorphism is also injective. When will the homomorphism be surjective? Since it’s injective, then it suffices that to show that \(|\mathbf{Z}_m| = |\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b|\). So when will they have the same size? Theorem If \(a, b \geq 1\) and \(gcd(a,b) = 1\). Then we have an isomorphism $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_m &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b, \quad (m = ab)\\ [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_a, [x]_b) \end{align*} $$ Fact: the reverse, if \(gcd(a,b) &gt; 1\), then \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b \not\cong \mathbf{Z}_{ab}\). Chinese Remainder Theorem The previous theorem is in fact the Chinese Remainder Theorem but the Chinese Remainder Theorem is stated in terms of modular arithmetic. Theorem If \(a, b \geq 1\), \(gcd(a,b) = 1\) and \(m = ab\). Then for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbf{Z}\), there exists \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\) such that $$ \begin{align*} x \equiv \alpha &amp;(\bmod a) \\ x \equiv \beta &amp;(\bmod b) \end{align*} $$ Furthermore, any two such \(x\) are congruent modulo \(m\). So now we can generalize our previous theorem to Theorem If \(a_1, a_2, ... a_r \geq 1\) and \(gcd(a_i, a_j) = 1\) if \(i \neq j\). Then there is an isomorphism $$ \begin{align*} \mathbf{Z}_m &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_{a_1} \times \mathbf{Z}_{a_2} \times ... \mathbf{Z}_{a_r}\\ [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_{a_1}, [x]_{a_2},...,[x]_{a_r}) \end{align*} $$ where \(m = a_1a_2....a_r\). For example: \(\mathbf{Z}_{240} = \mathbf{Z}_{16} \times \mathbf{Z}_3 \times \mathbf{Z}_5\) The Multiplicative Group Recall \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) is not just a group but a ring with two operations addition and multiplication. Inside this ring, we can focus on the elements that have a multiplicative inverse and form \(\Phi(n) = \{u \in \mathbf{Z}_n \ |\) u has a multiplicative inverse \(\} \subseteq \mathbf{Z}_n\). \((\Phi(n),\cdot)\) is a group with the multiplication operation. This group is also abelian and is called “modular units”. It is not a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). It turns out that we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to decompose \(\Phi(n)\), the modular units group. Before listing the theorem recall that if \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\). Then \([x]_n \in \Phi(n)\) if and only if \(gcd(x,n)=1\). Theorem If \(a, b \geq 1\), \(gcd(a, b) = 1\) and \(m = ab\). Then there is an isomorphism $$ \begin{align*} \Phi(m) &amp;\rightarrow \Phi(a) \times \Phi(b) \\ [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_{a}, [x]_{b}) \end{align*} $$ Proof Recall the isomorphism we established earlier $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_m &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b \\ [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_{a}, [x]_{b}) \end{align*} $$ This worked with addition.

Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup of \(G\). There is a bijection between \(B \leq G/N\) and the subgroup \(\pi^{-1}B\) (pre-image of \(B\) which is a subgroup of \(G\)).

<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) and \(N = \mathbf{Z}6\) (multiples of 6). Therefore \(G/N = \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}6 = \mathbf{Z}_6\). Here is a breakdown of the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}\). Within all of these subgroups you’ll see the \(\mathbf{Z}6\). The subgroups in the red outline will correspond to the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}6 = \mathbf{Z}_6\) on the left side.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec17/2.png" width="90%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Take another example. Suppose that \(N = \mathbf{Z}2\). Recall the definition of \(\pi\):</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi \ : \ \mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow (\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2 = \mathbf{Z}_2) \\ 
       \pi(x) &amp;= x + \mathbf{Z}2.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>For example \(x = 3\) and \(x = 6\). Then</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi(3) = 3 + \mathbf{Z}2 &amp;= \{...,3 + -4, 3 + -2, 3 + 0, 3 + 2, 3 + 4,...\} \\
                          &amp;= \{..., -1, 1, 3, 5, 7...\} = [1]_2 \\
\pi(6) = 6 + \mathbf{Z}2 &amp;= \{...,6 + -4, 6 + -2, 6 + 0, 6 + 2, 6 + 4,...\}  \\
                          &amp;= \{...,2, 4, 6, 8, 10...\} = [0]_2
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>In general, we will have exactly two cosets. Again \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2\) partitions \(\mathbf{Z}\) into two cosets. The coset of the even numbers and the coset of the odd numbers.
<br />
<br />
Now, we want to take their pre-image. Here the possible subsets in \(\mathbf{Z}_2\) are \([0]_2\) and \([1]_2\). BUT, the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}_2\) are only \(\{[0]\}\) and \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). \([1]\) is NOT a subgroup. So \(B = \{\{[0]\}, \mathbf{Z}_2\}\) in</p>

\begin{align*}
\pi^{-1}(B) = \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in B\}

<p>Applying it on each subgroup, we see that</p>

</div>
<p>So we see here that there is a bijective correspondance between \(\{[0]\}\) which is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2 = \mathbf{Z}_2\) and \(\mathbf{Z}2\) which is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}\).

<h4><b>Proof of the Correspondence Theorem</b></h4>
<p>So again, we want to show that there is a bijection between the subgroup \(d\) of the quotient group \(G/N\) and the subgroup of \(G\) which contain \(N\)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec17/1.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>
<p>One way to show that there is a bijection is to show that we have an inverse function.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can send a subgroup of the quotient group \(B \leq G/N\) its pre-image \(\pi^{-1}(B)\). We can easily show that \(\pi^{-1}(B)\) is a subgroup of \(G\). Recall that \(B\) is a collection of cosets \(B = \{gN \ | gN \leq G/N\}\) because it's a subgroup of the quotient group. The pre-image of \(B\) are elements of \(G\) such that they're the elements that make up the cosets. So if \(B =\{eN, aN, bN\}\), then its pre-image is \(\{e, a,b\}\) which is a subgroup of \(G\). Note here that we must have the identity element \(eN \in B\) since it's a subgroup. So we can see here that \(N\) is definitely contained in \(G\).</li>
<li>To go the other way. Suppose we have a subgroup of \(A \leq G\) containing \(N\). Now, to relate it to a subgroup inside \(G/N\), take its image under \(\pi\). We know \(\pi(A)\) by definition are the cosets \(\{\pi(a)=aN \ | \ a \in A\}\). \(\pi(A)\) is a subgroup of \(G/N\).</li>
</ul>
<p>So now we need to check two things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If \(B \leq G/N\), then \(\pi(\pi^{-1}(B)) = B\).</li>
	<li>If \(A \leq G\), then \(\pi^{-1}(\pi(A)) = A\).</li>
</ul>
<p>Remark: If we don’t know that \(A\) contains \(N\), then if \(A \leq G\), we can show that \(\pi(\pi(A)) = AN = \{an \ | \ a, n \in N\}\)

Recall that by the Isomorphism Theorem, that \(H \approx G/N\). By the previous Correspondance Theorem, we showed that subgroups of \(G/N\) correspond to subgroups of \(G\) containing \(N\). So we’ll have this picture</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec17/3.png" width="100%" class="center" /></p>

If \(A, B \leq G\), then \(AB\) is a subgroup if and only if \(AB = BA\).

<b>Proof</b>
<br />
\(\Rightarrow:\) Suppose that \(AB\) is a subgroup of \(G\). We want to show that \(AB = BA\). Let \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\). So \(x = ab \in AB\). But \(AB\) is a subgroup, so \(x^{-1} \in AB\).

We know that \(eb \in AB\) and \(ea \in AB\), so \((eb)(ae)\) must be in \(AB\) since \(AB\) is a subgroup. So \(BA \subseteq AB\). This proves that \(AB = BA\) as we wanted to show.

	<li>\(e \in AB\). This is because \(e \in A\) and \(e \in B\) so \(ee = e \in AB\).</li>
	<li>\(x, y \in AB\) implies that \(xy \in AB\). Suppose that \(a,a' \in A\) and \(b,b' \in B\). Then \(aba'b' = a(ba')b'\). \(ba' \in AB = BA\) by the hypothesis. So we can re-write \(ba'\) as \(a''b''\) for some \(a'' \in A\) and \(b'' \in B\). So now \(a(ba')b' = aa''b''b \in AB\)</li>

Recall that if \(G\) is a group and \(N\) was a normal subgroup of \(G\). And then we had a homomorphism \(\varphi: G \rightarrow H\) such that the kernel of \(\phi\) is contained in \(N\) (or easier to remember, \(\phi(N) = \{e\}\)). Then we get $$ \begin{align*} \varphi':G/N &amp;\rightarrow H \\ \phi'(xn) &amp;= \phi(x) \end{align*} $$ Then we studied the Isomorphism Theorem which requires additionally that the homomorphism \(\varphi:G \rightarrow H\) to be surjective as well as \(N = \ker(\varphi)\). Then, this will then get us an isomorphism \(\varphi': G/N \rightarrow H\). The Correspondence Theorem relates the subgroups of the quotient group \(G/N\) to the subgroups of \(G\) that contain \(N\). The theorem claims that there is a bijection or a bijective correspondance between the two groups. Correspondence Theorem Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup of \(G\). There is a bijection between \(B \leq G/N\) and the subgroup \(\pi^{-1}B\) (pre-image of \(B\) which is a subgroup of \(G\)). $$ \begin{align*} B \leq G/N \longrightarrow \pi^{-1}B \end{align*} $$ Recall that we defined the quotient homomorphism to be $$ \begin{align*} \pi \ : \ G &amp;\rightarrow G/N \\ \pi(x) &amp;= xN. \end{align*} $$ Also Recall the the pre-image of \(B\) is \(\pi^{-1}(B) = \{g \in G \ | \ \pi(g) \in B\}\) which we showed previously to be a subgroup of \(G\). Additionally, the theorem also claims that the normal subgroups of \(G/N\) correspond to the normal subgroups in \(G\) containing \(N\). Example Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) and \(N = \mathbf{Z}6\) (multiples of 6). Therefore \(G/N = \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}6 = \mathbf{Z}_6\). Here is a breakdown of the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}\). Within all of these subgroups you’ll see the \(\mathbf{Z}6\). The subgroups in the red outline will correspond to the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}6 = \mathbf{Z}_6\) on the left side. Take another example. Suppose that \(N = \mathbf{Z}2\). Recall the definition of \(\pi\): $$ \begin{align*} \pi \ : \ \mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow (\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2 = \mathbf{Z}_2) \\ \pi(x) &amp;= x + \mathbf{Z}2. \end{align*} $$ For example \(x = 3\) and \(x = 6\). Then $$ \begin{align*} \pi(3) = 3 + \mathbf{Z}2 &amp;= \{...,3 + -4, 3 + -2, 3 + 0, 3 + 2, 3 + 4,...\} \\ &amp;= \{..., -1, 1, 3, 5, 7...\} = [1]_2 \\ \pi(6) = 6 + \mathbf{Z}2 &amp;= \{...,6 + -4, 6 + -2, 6 + 0, 6 + 2, 6 + 4,...\} \\ &amp;= \{...,2, 4, 6, 8, 10...\} = [0]_2 \end{align*} $$ In general, we will have exactly two cosets. Again \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2\) partitions \(\mathbf{Z}\) into two cosets. The coset of the even numbers and the coset of the odd numbers. Now, we want to take their pre-image. Here the possible subsets in \(\mathbf{Z}_2\) are \([0]_2\) and \([1]_2\). BUT, the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}_2\) are only \(\{[0]\}\) and \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). \([1]\) is NOT a subgroup. So \(B = \{\{[0]\}, \mathbf{Z}_2\}\) in $$ \begin{align*} \pi^{-1}(B) = \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in B\} \end{align*} $$ Applying it on each subgroup, we see that $$ \begin{align*} \pi^{-1}(\{[0]\}) &amp;= \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in \{[0]\}\} \\ &amp;= \{-4, -2, 0, 2, 4,.... \} \\ &amp;= \mathbf{Z}2 \\ \pi^{-1}(\mathbf{Z}_2) &amp;= \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in \mathbf{Z}_2\} \\ &amp;= \mathbf{Z} \end{align*} $$ So we see here that there is a bijective correspondance between \(\{[0]\}\) which is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2 = \mathbf{Z}_2\) and \(\mathbf{Z}2\) which is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}\). Proof of the Correspondence Theorem So again, we want to show that there is a bijection between the subgroup \(d\) of the quotient group \(G/N\) and the subgroup of \(G\) which contain \(N\) One way to show that there is a bijection is to show that we have an inverse function. We can send a subgroup of the quotient group \(B \leq G/N\) its pre-image \(\pi^{-1}(B)\). We can easily show that \(\pi^{-1}(B)\) is a subgroup of \(G\). Recall that \(B\) is a collection of cosets \(B = \{gN \ | gN \leq G/N\}\) because it's a subgroup of the quotient group.

<p>In short, we’re following a recipe to construct a homomorphism. Given a homomorphism \(\varphi \ : \ G \rightarrow H\) and a normal subgroup \(N\) that is a subset of \(ker(\varphi) = K\) (which means that \(\varphi(N) = \{e\}\) since every element in the kernel is sent to the identity). THEN, we get another homomorphism \(\varphi\) from \(G/N\) to \(H\). The homomorphism is given by \(\varphi'(aN) = \varphi(a)\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>(1) First we need to check that \(\varphi'\) is well defined. This means that want to show that if \(aN = bN\) (in \(G/N\)), then \(\varphi'(a) = \varphi'(b)\) which is \(\varphi(a) = \varphi(b)\) in \(H\) by how we defined \(\varphi'\) above. Re-write \(aN = bN\) as</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    aN &amp;= bN \\
	b^{-1}aN &amp;= N.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So \(b^{-1}a \in N\). Now we can apply \(\varphi\) on it to get</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    \varphi(b^{-1}a) &amp;= \varphi(b^{-1})(a) \quad \text{(since $\varphi$ is a homomorphism)} \\
    e &amp;= \varphi(b^{-1})(a) \quad \text{(since $N \subseteq K$)} \\
    \varphi(b) &amp;= (a).
	
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So it’s well defined as we wanted to show. \(\blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
(2) Next, we want to show that it is a homomorphism. To see that observe that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    \varphi'(aN \cdot bN) &amp;= \varphi(abN) \quad \text{(def of quotient function)} \\
	                      &amp;= \varphi(ab) \quad \text{(def of $\varphi'$)} \\
						  &amp;= \varphi(a)\varphi(b) \quad \text{(def of a homomorphism)} \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>On the other hand</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    \varphi'(aN)\varphi'(bN) &amp;= \varphi(a)\varphi(b) \quad \text{(def of $\varphi'$)} \\

<br />
(3) Finally, we need to prove the conclusions of the theorem. The second statements claims that \(\phi'(G/N) = \phi(G)\). But this is true by how we defined \(\varphi'\). For the first statement which claims that \(ker(\varphi') = K/N = \{aN \ | \ aN \subseteq K\}\). First, we know that by the definition of the kernel that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    ker(\varphi') &amp;= \{aN \ | \ \varphi'(aN) = e_H \} \\
	              &amp;= \{aN \ | \ \varphi(a) = e_H \} \quad \text{(by def of $\varphi'$)} \\
				  &amp;= \{aN \ | \ a \in ker(\phi) = K \} \quad \text{($\varphi(a)=e$ so $a$ is in the kernel)} 
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Notice now that \(N\) is a subgroup of \(K\). This means that any coset of \(N\) will be contained in the corresponding coset of \(K\) so \(aN \subseteq aK\). But here it is the trivial coset so \(aK = eK = K\).

<h4><b>Isomorphism Theorem</b></h4>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Isomorphism Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup. Let \(\pi: G \rightarrow G/N\) be a homomorphism and let \(\phi : G \rightarrow H\) be a <b>surjective</b> homomorphism.<br /> 
Let \(K = ker(\phi)\) be a normal subgroup such that \(N = K\) (unlike before where \(N \subseteq K\)). Then <br />
There there is a isomorphism \(\varphi': G/N \rightarrow H\) with formula (same as before)
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi'(aN) = \varphi(a)
\end{align*}
$$
Unlike before, now \(\phi'(G/N) = H\) and the kernel \(ker(\varphi') = \{eN\}\) (the trivial coset of \(N\)).
</div>
<p><br />
So we have the same conditions as before except that \(N = K\) and the \(\phi\) is surjective. So we can apply the homomorphism theorem from before and we’ll get the same results as before. That is, a homomorphism \(\phi'\). But now since \(\phi\) is surjective and its image is the same as the image of \(\phi'\), then \(\phi'\) is also surjective. 
<br />
<br />
Moreover, its kernel per the homomorphism theorem is \(\{aN \ | \ aN \subseteq K\}\) (collection of all cosets of \(N\) that are contained in \(K\)). But now \(N = K\). There is only one coset of \(N\) contained in \(N\) which is the trivial coset \(eN\). so \(ker(\phi') = \{eN\}\). This implies that \(\phi'\) is injective. So \(\phi'\) is now a bijection which means that it’s an isomorphism.

<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Let \(H = \langle a \rangle\) be a finite cyclic group of order \(n\). </li>
<li>Let \(G = (\mathbf{Z}, +)\). </li>
<li>Let \(N = \mathbf{Z}n \unlhd \mathbf{Z}\) the group of multiples of \(n\) which is a subgroup of \(G = \mathbf{Z}\).</li>
<li>Let \(\phi: \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow H \) be a surjective homomorphism by the formula \(\phi(m) = a^m\)</li>

<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Let \(\mathbf{F}^{x} = \mathbf{F} \ \{0\}\). </li>
<li>Let \(GL_n(\mathbf{F}) = \{ A \in Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbf{F})\) such that \(A\) is invertible\(\}\) with matrix multiplication. </li>
<li>Let \(\phi: GL_n(\mathbf{F}) \rightarrow \mathbf{F}^{x} \) be a homomorphism by the formula \(\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)\). Is the determinant surjective? for any number \(a \in \mathbf{F}\), can we find a matrix satisfying such that its determinant is \(a\)? Yes! consider

The determinant of this matrix is \(a\). So this homomorphism is surjective.

<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 3</b></h4>
<p>We’re going to show that \(S_4 / N \approx S_3\). 
<br />
<br />
To do this, we’re going to produce a homomorphism from \(S_4\) to \(S_3\). But \(S_3\) is isomorphic to \(Sym(X)\) where \(X\) has 3 elements.
<br />
<br />
\(S_4\) is the set of permutations of a 4 element set. There is a trick that we can use to construct interesting homomorphisms out of a permutation group which is to find structures on the set that we’re permuting. For example define \(X\) to be the set of partitions of \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\) into two disjoint subsets of 2 each. So</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
   &amp;\quad \ \quad S_1 \quad \quad S_2 \quad \quad S_3 \\
X &amp;= \{12|34, 13|24, 14|23\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So we have 3 different ways of grouping these 4 elements. Suppose now we have a permutation in \(S_4\) as follows</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So now let’s apply \(g\) on the three elements in \(X\)</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
S_1 &amp;= 12|34 \xrightarrow{g} 23|14 = 14|23 = S_3 \\
S_2 &amp;= 13|24 \xrightarrow{g} 21|34 = 12|34 = S_1 \\
S_3 &amp;= 14|23 \xrightarrow{g} 24|31 = 13|24 = S_2.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So for the first example, we’re given \(12|34\). We’ll look up where each element goes in \(g\). For example 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3, 3 goes 1 and 4 stays fixed. So that’s exactly what we get which is \(S_3\).
<br />
<br />
So the permutation \(g\) sends \(S_1\) to \(S_3\), \(S_2\) to \(S_1\) and \(S_3\) to \(S_2\).</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}

\xrightarrow{\varphi}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Let’s now take another permutation \(g'\) in \(S_4\)</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g' = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
3 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So now let’s apply \(g'\) on the three elements in \(X\)</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
S_1 &amp;= 12|34 \xrightarrow{g} 21|43 = 12|23 = S_1 \\
S_2 &amp;= 13|24 \xrightarrow{g} 31|42 = 13|24 = S_2 \\
S_3 &amp;= 14|23 \xrightarrow{g} 41|32 = 14|23 = S_3.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So \(g'\) just takes \(X\) to itself</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
3 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}

\xrightarrow{\varphi}

\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
=
id \in S_3
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So here are some claims about \(\varphi\)</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(\varphi\) is a homomorphism from \(S_4\) to \(S_3\).</li>
	<li>\(\varphi\) is surjective. Recall that \(|S_4| = 24\) while \(|S_3| = 6\). (We still need to check (homework))</li>
	<li>\(K = ker(\phi)\) is a normal subgroup of \(S_4\). We can further deduce the order of \(K\). How? We know by the Isomorphism Theorem that the quotient group \(S_4/K\) is isomorphic \(S_3\) because \(\varphi\) is a surjective homomorphism and \(K\) is a normal subgroup. This tells us that these two groups have the same size. Since \(K\) is normal, we also know that the quotient group is the number of cosets. But by Lagrange's Theorem we know that \(\frac{|S_4|}{|K|}\) is equal to the number of cosets. So \(\frac{|S_4|}{|K|} = |S_4/K| = |S_3|\). Therefore, we see that \(|K| = 4\).</li>
	<li>In fact \(K = \{e, (1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 4)(2 \ 3), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4)\} \)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice here that we first proved that \(|K| = 4\) before finding the elements in \(K\). It’s just easier to verify that some element is in the kernel rather than finding the elements first.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 4</b></h4>
<p>Suppose that \(n \geq 3\). Let \(D_{2n}\) be the symmetries of regular \(2n\)-gon (even number of vertices.)<br /> 
We already know that if we have a symmetry of an \(n-\)gon, we get a permutation of its vertices. But there are other ways to construct a homomorphism. Consider the following homomorphism</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi \ : \ D_{2n} \rightarrow Sym(X) \approx S_n
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>where \(X\) be the set of diagonals of the polygon. For example, for \(n = 3\), we have 6 vertices. But we let’s think of the diagonals. We have 3 diagonals. Notice here that any symmetry will take a diagonal to another diagonal. If we label the diagonals, then a rotation will take diagonal 1 to diagonal 2 for example and diagonal 2 to diagonal 3 as shown below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec16/2.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>In fact, this homomorphism is surjective.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi \ : \ D_{6} \rightarrow S_3
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>The kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup of \(D_6\) and by the Isomorphism Theorem, the quotient group \(D_6/K\) is isomorphic to \(S_3\). How big is \(K\)? \(D_6\) has 12 elements and \(S_3\) has 6 elements. So \(K\) must have \(2\) elements. The kernel is \(\{e, r^3\}\).

<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(H\) be a subgroup. For \(a, b \in G\), define \(a \sim_H b\) to mean 
$$
\begin{align*}
b = ah \quad \text{ for some } h \in H
\end{align*}
$$
In other words, \(a \sim_H b\) if \(a^{-1}b \in H\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
We claim that \(\sim_H\) is an equivalence relation. [Exercise: Prove it]
<br />
<br />
The equivalence classes are the left cosets \(aH = \{ah \ | \ h \in H\}\). 
<br />
<br />
Now define \(G / H\) to be the collection of left \(H\)-cosets in \(G\) so \(G / H = \{ aH \ | \ a \in G\}\). Define the Quotient function as follows</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi \ : \ &amp;G \rightarrow G / H \\
     &amp;\pi(g) = gH.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So \(\pi\) sends an element to the coset it is contained in. Of course we can do the same thing for right cosets. We need a different notation so we’ll use a backward slash for right cosets \(G \backslash H\). So \(G \backslash H = \{ Ha \ | \ a \in G\}\). The Quotient function is</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi' \ : \ &amp;G \rightarrow G \backslash H \\
     &amp;\pi'(g) = Hg
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) and let \(H = \mathbf{Z}n\) where \(n \geq 0\) (multiples of \(n\)). Then the set of left cosets is</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
G / H &amp;= \{[a]_n \ | \ a \in \mathbf{Z}\} \\
      &amp;= \mathbf{Z}_n
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Side note: Why? so say \(H = \mathbf{Z}3\), then \(H = \{...,-6,-3,0,3,6,9,...\}\) and the left cosets are</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
0 + H, 1 + H, 2 + H, 3 + H, ...
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>For example</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
0 + H &amp;= \{...,-6,-3,0,3,6,9,...\} = [0]_3 \\
1 + H &amp;= \{...,-5,-2,1,4,7,10,...\} = [1]_3 \\
2 + H &amp;= \{...,-4,-1,2,5,8,11,...\} = [2]_3 \\
3 + H &amp;= \{...,-3,0,3,6,9,12,...\} = 0 + H \\
4 + H &amp;= \{...,-2,1,4,7,10,13,...\} = 1 + H \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>From this we see that \(3H = 0H\), \(4H = 1H\) and so on. There are exactly 3 distinct left cosets. These three left cosets are exactly \(Z_3 = \{[0], [1], [2]\}\).
<br />
<br />
So now we see that \(G / H = \mathbf{Z}_n\). This is a group. In fact \(\pi \ : \ \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}n\) is a homomorphism.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Quotient Function</b></h4>
<p>The question now is if we can do this in general. If we have a group \(G\) and a subgroup \(H \leq G\). We want to put a group structure on the set of left \(H\)-cosets, \(G / H\) such that \(\pi \ : \ G \rightarrow G / H\) is a homomorphism? This is called the “Quotient Group”.
<br />
<br />
Also if we make that happen and \(\pi\) is a homomorphism. What would the kernel of \(\pi\) be? By definition:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
ker(\pi) &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ \pi(g) = e_{G/H}\} \\
         &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = e_{G/H}\} \quad \text{(By def, $\pi(a) = aH$)} \\
         &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = \pi(e_G)\} \quad \text{($\pi$ is a homomorphism so $\pi(e_G) = e_{G/H}$)} \\
         &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = eH\} \quad \text{(by def of $\pi$ again)} \\
		 &amp;= H.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>But we also know that kernels are normal subgroups so this means that \(H\) must be a normal subgroup. So if we make \(\pi\) a homomorphism, then we’ll see that \(H\) is actually a normal subgroup. [Is this right?]
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Quotient Group</b></h4>
<p>Now suppose we have a group \(G\) and a normal subgroup \(N\). Define \(G/N\) to be the set of all left cosets of \(N\) so \(G/N = \{ aN \ | \ a \in G \}\). In fact since \(N\) is normal, the left cosets are the right cosets so we don’t need to say left or right in the definition. Let’s also define a group operation on the group \(G/N\).</p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup. Define the operation on \(G/N\) by
$$
\begin{align*}
aN \cdot bN = (ab)N
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
The goal is to show that \((G / N, \cdot)\) is a group. But first we need to show that the operation we defined is well-defined (We also want to show that this operation is a homomorphism later). So we need to show that if \(aN = a'N\) and \(bN = b'N\), then \((ab)N = (a'b')N\).
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof (well-defined)</b>
<br />
Since \(aN = a'N\), then \(a'\) is in the coset \(aN\) and we can write \(a' = an_1\) for some \(n_1 \in N\). Similarly, \(bN = b'N\) so we can write \(b' = bn_2\) for some \(n_2 \in N\). We want to show that \(a'b' = abn\) for some \(n \in N\). Now,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a'b' &amp;= an_1bn_2 \\
     &amp;= a(bb^{-1})n_1bn_2 \\
	 &amp;= (ab)(b^{-1}n_1bn_2)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So now we want to show that \(b^{-1}n_1bn_2 \in N\). We know that \(N\) is a normal subgroup. So if we conjugate \(n\) by \(b^{-1}\), then we know that \(b^{-1}nb \in N\) because \(N\) is normal. Moreover, \((b^{-1}nb)(n_2) \in N\) since \(N\) is a subgroup. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof (\((G/N, \cdot)\) is a group)</b>
<br />
To show this, we need to verify the group properties</p>
<ol>
	<li>Associative: We want to show that \((aN \cdot bN) \cdot cN = aN \cdot (bN \cdot cN)\)
		<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		(aN \cdot bN) \cdot cN &amp;= abN \cdot cN \\
		                       &amp;= (ab)cN \\
							   &amp;= a(bc)N \quad \text{(multiplication is associative)} \\
							   &amp;= aN \cdot (bN \cdot cN).
		\end{align*}
		$$
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>Identity: The identity element is \((eN)\)</li>
	<li>Inverses: We want to show that \((aN)^{-1}\) is an inverse of \(aN\).</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, \((G/N, \cdot)\) is a group.
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof (homomorphism)</b>
<br />
Next we want to show that \(\pi: G \rightarrow G/N\) is a homomorphism with kernel \(ker(\pi) = N\). Recall that \(\pi(a) = aN\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = D_4 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j\}\). We established the identities \(r^4 = e = j^2\) and \(jr = r^{-1}j\). We first claim that \(N = \langle r^2 \rangle = \{e, r^2\}\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\). Why? For any \(g \in D_4\), we have \(g r^2 g^{-1} \in \langle r^2 \rangle\).
<br />
<br />
Since \(N\) is normal, then we can form the quotient group \(G / N\) where</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	G/N = D_4/N = \{eN, rN, jN, rjN\}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Note that the other possibilities end up being the same as one of the four cosets above. For example \(r^2N = eN\) and \(r^3N = rN\). Note also that this matches Lagrange’s Theorem. By Lagrange, we expect to have \(|G|/|N|\) cosets. \(|G| = 8\) and \(|N| = 2\) so we indeed have 4 elements.
<br />
<br />
Since \(D_4/N\) has 4 elements, then we expect this group to be isomorphic to either the cyclic group of order 4 or the non-cyclic one. How do we know? We can calculate the order of the elements in the group. If there is an element of order 4, then it’s cyclic. If there is not, then it can’t be cyclic. For example \((rN)^2 = r^2N = eN\). Why? \(r^2N\) is the coset</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\{r^2(e), r^2(r^2)\} = \{r^2, e\} = eN.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>What about \((jN)^2\)?</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(jN)^2=j^2N = eN.

	$$
</div>
<p>Next, \((rjN)^2 = (rj)^2N\) But \(rj\) is a flip so it’s square is \(e\) and so \((rjN)^2 = eN\). So every element’s square is the identity and no element has order 4. So it’s isomorphic to \(V\).

<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<p>Now consider \(D_6 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j, r^5j\}\). Consider \(N = \langle r^3 \rangle = \{e, r^3\}\) which is a normal subgroup of \(D_6\). Why is it normal? Because if we conjugate it with any element from \(D_6\), we will get the same set</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	r^k r^3 r^{-k} &amp;= r^3 \\
	rj r^3 (rj)^{-1} &amp;= jr^{-1} r^3 r j^{-1} = r^3 \\
	....
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is actually because \(r^3g = gr^3\) for all \(g \in G\). This is a property of \(r^3\). (in this case \(r^3\) is called “central”). Moreover, \(G/N\) will have \(|G|/|H| = 6\) cosets.</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	G/N = D_6 / \langle r^3 \rangle = \{eN, rN, r^2N, jN, rjN, r^2jN\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>As a reminder, because \(N\) is a normal subgroup, \(G/N\) is a group. It’s a group of order 6. There are two groups of order 6. The abelian cyclic one and \(D_3\) which is isomorphic to \(S_3\). To determine which one, we need to find the order of the elements. Any flip will have order two and so it turns out that \(jN, rjN, r^2jN\) all have order 2. \(eN\) has order 1. For the rest</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(rN)^3 = r^3N = \{(r^3)e, (r^3)r^3\} = \{e, r^3\} = eN.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>In fact, \(r^2N\) has order 3 as well. So none of the elements have order 6 and so this group is not cyclic. It is in fact isomorphic to \(D_3\).

<h4><b>Example 3</b></h4>
<p>Now consider \(G = (\mathbf{R}, +)\) and \(H = (\mathbf{Z}, +)\). \(G\) is abelian. Therefore, all of its subgroups are normal and \(H\) is normal. Now let’s form the quotient group as follows</p>

Let \(T\) be the set of rotations around the \(z\) axis so \(T = \{r_{\theta} = Rot_{e_3}(\theta) \ | \ \theta \in \mathbf{R}\}\). This is a subgroup of \(SO(3)\). Note here that \(r_{\theta + 2\pi n} = r_{\theta}\). It turns out that \(\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}\) is isomorphic to \(T\). The isomorphism is</p>
<div>

<h4><b>Symmetric Groups</b></h4>
<p>We want to know what the normal subgroups of symmetric groups are. In order to do so, we want to see what happens if we conjugate a permutation \(\tau\) with element so \(\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\)?
<br />
<br />
In turns out in symmetric groups, there is a way to understand conjugation. We actually have a formula. This formula is called the <b>cycle conjugation formula</b>. Given \(\tau = (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... a_k) \in S_n\) where \(\tau\) is a permutation consisting of a \(k-\)cycle with \(a_1,a_2... \in \{1,2,....,n\}\). Then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} &amp;= (b_1 \ b_2 \ ... b_k) \quad \text{where } b_i = \sigma(a_i) \\
	                                         &amp;= (\sigma(a_1) \ \sigma(a_2) \ ...\ \sigma(a_k))
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So we actually get another \(k\) cycle.
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We want to show that 
\(\sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} = (\sigma(a_1) \ \sigma(a_2) \ ... \ \sigma(a_k))\). We will compute the new permutation directly. Let \(x \in \{1,2,...,n\}\). It turns out that there are two cases.
<br />
<br />
Case 1: \(x = \sigma(a_i)\):<br />
So now we’ll apply the permutation on \(x\). First we apply \(\sigma^{-1}\) but since \(x = \sigma(a_i)\), then we will just get \(a_i\). Next, we’ll apply the cycle and here we’ll get \(a_{i+1}\) since it’s a cycle. Lastly, we need to apply \(\sigma\). So we get \(\sigma(a_{i+1})\). (There is a subtlety here because \(a_{i+1}\) for \(i = k\), is \(i = 1\). To fix this, we’ll let \(a_{k+1} = 1\) or just have two cases). So in summary:</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} (x) &amp;= \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} (\sigma(a_i)) \\
	                                               &amp;= \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) (a_i) \\
												   &amp;=  \begin{cases} a_{j+1} \quad &amp;\text{if } j \neq k \\ a_1 \quad \quad &amp;\text{if } j = k\end{cases}

	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Case 2: \(x \neq \sigma(a_i)\) for any \(i\)<br />
Apply \(\sigma^{-1}\) to get \(\sigma^{-1}(x) \neq a_i\) for any \(i\). This means that the cycle actually doesn’t do anything to \(x\). So \(x\) is in fact fixed. So</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} (x) &amp;= \sigma ( \sigma^{-1} (a_i)) \\
	                                               &amp;= x.

	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>From Case 1 and Case 2, we see that \(\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\) is the \(k\)-cycle \((\sigma(a_1) \ \sigma(a_2) \ ...\ \sigma(a_k))\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Cycle Conjugation Formula Application</b></h4>
<p>Suppose we have an element \(\tau = \tau_1 \tau_2 ... \tau_r \in S_n\) where each \(\tau_i\) is a cycle. Now suppose we have another element \(\sigma\). Then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} &amp;= \sigma \tau_1 \tau_2 ... \tau_r \sigma^{-1} \\
	                        &amp;= \sigma \tau_1 (\sigma^{-1}\sigma) \tau_2 (\sigma^{-1}\sigma) ... (\sigma^{-1}\sigma) \tau_r \sigma^{-1} \\
							&amp;= (\sigma \tau_1 \sigma^{-1}) (\sigma \tau_2 \sigma^{-1}) \sigma ... \sigma^{-1} (\sigma \tau_r \sigma^{-1}) \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So if we have a permutation \(\tau\) that has a cycle decomposition and therefore a cycle type (cycle decomposition meaning that it can be decomposed into disjoint cycles). Then if we conjugate the permutation, the conjugate will also have exactly the same cycle type as \(\tau\). So two facts
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Fact
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
\(\forall \ \sigma, \tau \in S_n\), \(\tau\) and \(\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\) have the same cycle type.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Fact
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(\tau, \tau' \in S_n\) have the same cycle type. Then \(\tau' = \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\) for some \(\sigma \in S_n\). 
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<p>For example, let \(\sigma = (1 \ 3 \ 4 \ 7 \ 2 \ 5) \in S_9\) and let \(\tau = (2 \ 9)(1 \ 8 \ 7)\). If we conjugate \(\tau\) with \(\sigma\), then we know by the previous fact that the cycle type will remain the same. This means that we will get a 3-cycle followed by a 2-cycle \((a_1 \ a_2 \ a_3)(a_4 \ a_5)\). Furthermore, to figure out these new numbers. We just apply sigma on \(\tau\), meaning that we permute the elements in \(\tau\) according to \(\sigma\). For example, \(\sigma\) sends 2 to 5. so we’ll replace 2 with 5 in \(\tau\). \(\sigma\) doesn’t do anything to 6 so it just stays and so on.</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sigma &amp;= (1 \ 3 \ 4 \ 7 \ 2 \ 5) \\
	\tau &amp;= (2 \ 9)(1 \ 8 \ 7) \\
	\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} &amp;= (5 \ 6)(3 \ 8 \ 2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We can also ask, given \(\tau\) and given \(\tau' = (5 \ 6)(3 \ 8 \ 2)\). How can we produce \(\sigma\) such that \(\tau' = \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\)? For this, it is easier to right \(\sigma\) using the two notation. So now we will look at \(\tau\) see that the first element is 2 and 2 goes to 5 in \(\tau'\). The second element is 9 and to goes to 6 in \(\tau'\) (position wise) and so. Therefore</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\tau &amp;= (2 \ 9)(1 \ 8 \ 7) \\
	\tau' &amp;= (5 \ 6)(3 \ 8 \ 2) \\
	\sigma &amp;= 
	\begin{pmatrix}
	1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\
	3 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 9 &amp; 6 &amp; 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 7
	\end{pmatrix}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Notice that for the other elements 3. We don’t care where it goes as long it goes somewhere. As a reminder, \(\sigma\) is not unique and there could be many \(\sigma\)’s such that \(\tau = \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\).

<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = S_3\) and \(N = \{e, (1 \ 2 \ 3), (1 \ 3\ 2)\} \leq S_3\).
<br />
<br />
Observation: A subgroup \(H \leq S_n\) is normal if and only if whenever \(g \in H\), then so is every element with the same cycle type as \(g\). 
<br />
<br />
Based on this, \(H = \{e, (1 \ 2)\} \leq S_3\). \(H\) is not normal since it doesn’t have all the elements of the same cycle type. Other normal subgroups of \(S_n\) are \(\{e\}\), \(A_n = ker(sgn)\) even permutations. And if \(n = 4\), \(K = \{e, (1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4), (1 \ 4),(2 \ 3)\}\).

For \(a, b \in G\), define \(a \sim_H b\) to mean $$ \begin{align*} b = ah \quad \text{ for some } h \in H \end{align*} $$ In other words, \(a \sim_H b\) if \(a^{-1}b \in H\). We claim that \(\sim_H\) is an equivalence relation. [Exercise: Prove it] The equivalence classes are the left cosets \(aH = \{ah \ | \ h \in H\}\). Now define \(G / H\) to be the collection of left \(H\)-cosets in \(G\) so \(G / H = \{ aH \ | \ a \in G\}\). Define the Quotient function as follows $$ \begin{align*} \pi \ : \ &amp;G \rightarrow G / H \\ &amp;\pi(g) = gH. \end{align*} $$ So \(\pi\) sends an element to the coset it is contained in. Of course we can do the same thing for right cosets. We need a different notation so we’ll use a backward slash for right cosets \(G \backslash H\). So \(G \backslash H = \{ Ha \ | \ a \in G\}\). The Quotient function is $$ \begin{align*} \pi' \ : \ &amp;G \rightarrow G \backslash H \\ &amp;\pi'(g) = Hg \end{align*} $$ Example Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) and let \(H = \mathbf{Z}n\) where \(n \geq 0\) (multiples of \(n\)). Then the set of left cosets is $$ \begin{align*} G / H &amp;= \{[a]_n \ | \ a \in \mathbf{Z}\} \\ &amp;= \mathbf{Z}_n \end{align*} $$ Side note: Why? so say \(H = \mathbf{Z}3\), then \(H = \{...,-6,-3,0,3,6,9,...\}\) and the left cosets are $$ \begin{align*} 0 + H, 1 + H, 2 + H, 3 + H, ... \end{align*} $$ For example $$ \begin{align*} 0 + H &amp;= \{...,-6,-3,0,3,6,9,...\} = [0]_3 \\ 1 + H &amp;= \{...,-5,-2,1,4,7,10,...\} = [1]_3 \\ 2 + H &amp;= \{...,-4,-1,2,5,8,11,...\} = [2]_3 \\ 3 + H &amp;= \{...,-3,0,3,6,9,12,...\} = 0 + H \\ 4 + H &amp;= \{...,-2,1,4,7,10,13,...\} = 1 + H \\ \end{align*} $$ From this we see that \(3H = 0H\), \(4H = 1H\) and so on. There are exactly 3 distinct left cosets. These three left cosets are exactly \(Z_3 = \{[0], [1], [2]\}\). So now we see that \(G / H = \mathbf{Z}_n\). This is a group. In fact \(\pi \ : \ \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}n\) is a homomorphism. Quotient Function The question now is if we can do this in general. If we have a group \(G\) and a subgroup \(H \leq G\). We want to put a group structure on the set of left \(H\)-cosets, \(G / H\) such that \(\pi \ : \ G \rightarrow G / H\) is a homomorphism? This is called the “Quotient Group”. Also if we make that happen and \(\pi\) is a homomorphism. What would the kernel of \(\pi\) be? By definition: $$ \begin{align*} ker(\pi) &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ \pi(g) = e_{G/H}\} \\ &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = e_{G/H}\} \quad \text{(By def, $\pi(a) = aH$)} \\ &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = \pi(e_G)\} \quad \text{($\pi$ is a homomorphism so $\pi(e_G) = e_{G/H}$)} \\ &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = eH\} \quad \text{(by def of $\pi$ again)} \\ &amp;= H. \end{align*} $$ But we also know that kernels are normal subgroups so this means that \(H\) must be a normal subgroup. So if we make \(\pi\) a homomorphism, then we’ll see that \(H\) is actually a normal subgroup. [Is this right?] Quotient Group Now suppose we have a group \(G\) and a normal subgroup \(N\). Define \(G/N\) to be the set of all left cosets of \(N\) so \(G/N = \{ aN \ | \ a \in G \}\). In fact since \(N\) is normal, the left cosets are the right cosets so we don’t need to say left or right in the definition. Let’s also define a group operation on the group \(G/N\). Definition Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup. Define the operation on \(G/N\) by $$ \begin{align*} aN \cdot bN = (ab)N \end{align*} $$ The goal is to show that \((G / N, \cdot)\) is a group. But first we need to show that the operation we defined is well-defined (We also want to show that this operation is a homomorphism later). So we need to show that if \(aN = a'N\) and \(bN = b'N\), then \((ab)N = (a'b')N\). Proof (well-defined) Since \(aN = a'N\), then \(a'\) is in the coset \(aN\) and we can write \(a' = an_1\) for some \(n_1 \in N\). Similarly, \(bN = b'N\) so we can write \(b' = bn_2\) for some \(n_2 \in N\). We want to show that \(a'b' = abn\) for some \(n \in N\). Now, $$ \begin{align*} a'b' &amp;= an_1bn_2 \\ &amp;= a(bb^{-1})n_1bn_2 \\ &amp;= (ab)(b^{-1}n_1bn_2) \end{align*} $$ So now we want to show that \(b^{-1}n_1bn_2 \in N\). We know that \(N\) is a normal subgroup. So if we conjugate \(n\) by \(b^{-1}\), then we know that \(b^{-1}nb \in N\) because \(N\) is normal. Moreover, \((b^{-1}nb)(n_2) \in N\) since \(N\) is a subgroup. \(\ \blacksquare\) Proof (\((G/N, \cdot)\) is a group) To show this, we need to verify the group properties Associative: We want to show that \((aN \cdot bN) \cdot cN = aN \cdot (bN \cdot cN)\) $$ \begin{align*} (aN \cdot bN) \cdot cN &amp;= abN \cdot cN \\ &amp;= (ab)cN \\ &amp;= a(bc)N \quad \text{(multiplication is associative)} \\ &amp;= aN \cdot (bN \cdot cN). \end{align*} $$ Identity: The identity element is \((eN)\) Inverses: We want to show that \((aN)^{-1}\) is an inverse of \(aN\). Therefore, \((G/N, \cdot)\) is a group. Proof (homomorphism) Next we want to show that \(\pi: G \rightarrow G/N\) is a homomorphism with kernel \(ker(\pi) = N\). Recall that \(\pi(a) = aN\). Example 1 Let \(G = D_4 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j\}\). We established the identities \(r^4 = e = j^2\) and \(jr = r^{-1}j\). We first claim that \(N = \langle r^2 \rangle = \{e, r^2\}\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\). Why? For any \(g \in D_4\), we have \(g r^2 g^{-1} \in \langle r^2 \rangle\). Since \(N\) is normal, then we can form the quotient group \(G / N\) where $$ \begin{align*} G/N = D_4/N = \{eN, rN, jN, rjN\}. \end{align*} $$ Note that the other possibilities end up being the same as one of the four cosets above. For example \(r^2N = eN\) and \(r^3N = rN\). Note also that this matches Lagrange’s Theorem. By Lagrange, we expect to have \(|G|/|N|\) cosets. \(|G| = 8\) and \(|N| = 2\) so we indeed have 4 elements. Since \(D_4/N\) has 4 elements, then we expect this group to be isomorphic to either the cyclic group of order 4 or the non-cyclic one. How do we know? We can calculate the order of the elements in the group. If there is an element of order 4, then it’s cyclic. If there is not, then it can’t be cyclic. For example \((rN)^2 = r^2N = eN\). Why? \(r^2N\) is the coset $$ \begin{align*} \{r^2(e), r^2(r^2)\} = \{r^2, e\} = eN. \end{align*} $$ What about \((jN)^2\)? $$ \begin{align*} (jN)^2=j^2N = eN. \end{align*} $$ Next, \((rjN)^2 = (rj)^2N\) But \(rj\) is a flip so it’s square is \(e\) and so \((rjN)^2 = eN\). So every element’s square is the identity and no element has order 4. So it’s isomorphic to \(V\). Example 2 Now consider \(D_6 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j, r^5j\}\). Consider \(N = \langle r^3 \rangle = \{e, r^3\}\) which is a normal subgroup of \(D_6\). Why is it normal? Because if we conjugate it with any element from \(D_6\), we will get the same set $$ \begin{align*} r^k r^3 r^{-k} &amp;= r^3 \\ rj r^3 (rj)^{-1} &amp;= jr^{-1} r^3 r j^{-1} = r^3 \\ .... \end{align*} $$ This is actually because \(r^3g = gr^3\) for all \(g \in G\). This is a property of \(r^3\). (in this case \(r^3\) is called “central”). Moreover, \(G/N\) will have \(|G|/|H| = 6\) cosets. $$ \begin{align*} G/N = D_6 / \langle r^3 \rangle = \{eN, rN, r^2N, jN, rjN, r^2jN\} \end{align*} $$ As a reminder, because \(N\) is a normal subgroup, \(G/N\) is a group. It’s a group of order 6. There are two groups of order 6. The abelian cyclic one and \(D_3\) which is isomorphic to \(S_3\). To determine which one, we need to find the order of the elements. Any flip will have order two and so it turns out that \(jN, rjN, r^2jN\) all have order 2. \(eN\) has order 1. For the rest $$ \begin{align*} (rN)^3 = r^3N = \{(r^3)e, (r^3)r^3\} = \{e, r^3\} = eN. \end{align*} $$ In fact, \(r^2N\) has order 3 as well. So none of the elements have order 6 and so this group is not cyclic. It is in fact isomorphic to \(D_3\). Example 3 Now consider \(G = (\mathbf{R}, +)\) and \(H = (\mathbf{Z}, +)\). \(G\) is abelian. Therefore, all of its subgroups are normal and \(H\) is normal. Now let’s form the quotient group as follows $$ \begin{align*} G/H = \mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z} = \{a + \mathbf{Z} \ | \ a \in \mathbf{R}\}. \end{align*} $$ \(a + \mathbf{Z} = [a] = \{a + n \ | \ n \in \mathbf{Z}\}\) is a \(\mathbf{Z}\) coset of \(a\). For example if \(a = \frac{1}{3}\), then $$ \begin{align*} \frac{1}{3} + \mathbf{Z} = \{...,-1 + \frac{1}{3}, 0 + \frac{1}{3}, 1 + \frac{1}{3}, ...\} \subseteq \mathbf{R} \end{align*} $$ \(G/H\) is a group under addition where \([a] + [b] = [a + b]\). This group is abelian. What is this group isomorphic to? Let \(T\) be the set of rotations around the \(z\) axis so \(T = \{r_{\theta} = Rot_{e_3}(\theta) \ | \ \theta \in \mathbf{R}\}\). This is a subgroup of \(SO(3)\). Note here that \(r_{\theta + 2\pi n} = r_{\theta}\). It turns out that \(\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}\) is isomorphic to \(T\). The isomorphism is $$ \begin{align*} \mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow T \\ [x] &amp;\rightarrow r_{2\pi x} \end{align*} $$ Example 4 Let \(F\) be a field. (\(F = \mathbf{R}\) or \(\mathbf{C}\) or \(\mathbf{Z}p\), \(p\) is prime). Now let $$ \begin{align*} GL_n(F) = \{ A \in Mat_{n \times n}(F) \ | \ A^{-1} \text{ exists }\} \end{align*} $$ where the product is matrix multiplication. A normal subgroup here is $$ \begin{align*} H = \{cI, c \in F^{x}\} \quad \text{ (where } F^{x} = F - \{0\}). \end{align*} $$ Why is this a normal subgroup? because you can pull out scalars in matrix multiplication so \(A^{-1}cA = cA^{-1}A = cI\). We can form the quotient group $$ \begin{align*} GL_{n}(F) / H = PGL_n(F) \quad \quad \text{ (The Projective Linear Group) } \end{align*} $$ Symmetric Groups We want to know what the normal subgroups of symmetric groups are. In order to do so, we want to see what happens if we conjugate a permutation \(\tau\) with element so \(\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\)? In turns out in symmetric groups, there is a way to understand conjugation. We actually have a formula. This formula is called the cycle conjugation formula. Given \(\tau = (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... a_k) \in S_n\) where \(\tau\) is a permutation consisting of a \(k-\)cycle with \(a_1,a_2... \in \{1,2,....,n\}\). Then $$ \begin{align*} \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} &amp;= (b_1 \ b_2 \ ... b_k) \quad \text{where } b_i = \sigma(a_i) \\ &amp;= (\sigma(a_1) \ \sigma(a_2) \ ...\ \sigma(a_k)) \end{align*} $$ So we actually get another \(k\) cycle. Proof We want to show that \(\sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} = (\sigma(a_1) \ \sigma(a_2) \ ... \ \sigma(a_k))\). We will compute the new permutation directly. Let \(x \in \{1,2,...,n\}\). It turns out that there are two cases. Case 1: \(x = \sigma(a_i)\): So now we’ll apply the permutation on \(x\). First we apply \(\sigma^{-1}\) but since \(x = \sigma(a_i)\), then we will just get \(a_i\). Next, we’ll apply the cycle and here we’ll get \(a_{i+1}\) since it’s a cycle. Lastly, we need to apply \(\sigma\). So we get \(\sigma(a_{i+1})\). (There is a subtlety here because \(a_{i+1}\) for \(i = k\), is \(i = 1\). To fix this, we’ll let \(a_{k+1} = 1\) or just have two cases). So in summary: $$ \begin{align*} \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} (x) &amp;= \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} (\sigma(a_i)) \\ &amp;= \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) (a_i) \\ &amp;= \begin{cases} a_{j+1} \quad &amp;\text{if } j \neq k \\ a_1 \quad \quad &amp;\text{if } j = k\end{cases}]]></summary></entry></feed>
