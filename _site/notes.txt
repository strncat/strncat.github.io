Proposition 4: "IF two triangles have two sides of the one respectively equal to two sides of the other, and the angles contained by those equal sides also equal; then their bases or their sides  are also equal: and the remaining and their remaining angles opposite to equal sides are respectively equal: and the triangles are equal in every respect."

Basically, given two triangles where two of the sides are equal and the angles contained between the two sides in each triangle are also equal, then the two triangles are equal in every other respect meaning that the third side is also equal and the remaining two angles are equal as well.

Proof:
Let the triangles be $ABC$ and $DEF$. Let the two sides be arbitrarily chosen. Suppose we have $AB = DE$ and $BC = EF$ and the angle $ABC = DEF$ (hypothesis). Now, place the vertex $A$ onto the vertex $D$. First, because the angles are equal, the line $AB$ will fall onto the line $DE$ and second because we know that $AB = DE$, then the vertex $A$ must coincide with the vertex $D$. Similarly, the vertex $C$ must coincide with the vertex $F$.

So now we have all the vertices coinciding exactly with the three other vertices in the second triangle. We can conclude two things. Consequently, the side $AC$ will coincide with the side $DF$. This is because of axiom 8 and 10. Axiom 8 states that magnitudes which coincide with one another, or exactly fill the same space are equal and also the fact that only one straight line can be drawn between two points (axiom 10 states that two straight lines cannot include a space). Also, since all the vertices coincide with each other and all the sides are equal, then the triangles coincide with each other and the remaining angles will also be equal (axiom 8, magnitudes which coincide with one another or exactly fill the same space, are equal). 

Thoughts: 
(1) When we placed $A$ onto $D$, we concluded two things. First, because the angles are equal, the line $AB$ will fall onto the line $DE$. Second, because it's given than $AB = DE$, then $A$ must coincide with $D$. I hard to wrap my head around this for a little longer.
(2) It's not very obvious to me still why the third side or base must equal to the original base. Yes I know that axiom 8 states that magnitudes which coincide with one another or exactly fill the same space are equal. But I think a result that says only one straight line can be drawn between two points (is this just axiom 10?)
