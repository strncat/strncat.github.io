1.3: Problem 16: Find a positive integer \(n\) such that \(n/2\) is a square, \(n/3\) is a cube, and \(n/5\) is a fifth power.
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Solution</h3>
We want to construct a number that is divisible by 2, 3 and 5. Therefore, we need this number to be of the form
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
n = 2^a \cdot 3^b \cdot 5^c
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
Next, we want $$n/2$$ to be a square, this means that we need each exponent to be even in 
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
n/2 = 2^{a-1} \cdot 3^b \cdot 5^c
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
Similarly, we want $$n/3$$ to be a cube. This means that each exponent is divisible by 3 in 
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
n/3 = 2^a \cdot 3^{b-1} \cdot 5^c
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
Finally, we want $$n/5$$ to be a fifth power. This means that each exponent is divisible by 5 in
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
n/5 = 2^a \cdot 3^b \cdot 5^{c-1}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
So let's analyze the constraints on each exponent. For $$a$$, we want $$a - 1$$ to be even so $$a$$ must be odd. $$a$$ must also be divisible by 3 and by 5. The smallest number satisfying this is $$a = 15$$. For $$b$$, we want $$b$$ to be even and divisible by 5. We also need $$b-1$$ to be divisible by 3. The smallest integer satisfying these conditions is $$b = 10$$. Finally, $$c-1$$ needs to be divisible by 5. $$c$$ is even and divisible by 3. 6 is divisible by 3 and even and 6-1 is divisible by 5. Therefore, we have
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
n = 2^{15} \cdot 3^{10} \cdot 5^{6} = 30,233,088,000,000.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
