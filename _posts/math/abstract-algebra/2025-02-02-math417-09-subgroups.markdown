Definition 2.2.1
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
A non-empty subset \(H\) of a group \(G\) is called a subgroup if \(H\) is itself a group with the group operation inherited from \(G\). We write \(H \leq G\) to indicate that \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\).
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<br>
<br>
Example:
<ul>
	<li>The group \(SO(3)\), the special orthogonal matrices is a subgroup of \(GL_3(\mathbf{R}\), the group of invertible \(3 \times 3\) matrices. Both of these are under the same operation.</li>
	<li>Non-example: \(\mathbf{Z}_n\): congruence classes modulo \(n\) with addition. We also have \(\phi(n)\): congruence classes with multiplicative inverses. This has the operation multiplication so it's not a subgroup! Even when you define \(\phi(4) = \{[1],[3]\}\) with addition, it will not satisfy the group requirements, so it's not a subgroup.</li>
</ul>
Since we need to check a lot for subgroups. We have a set of necessary conditions.
<br>
<br>

<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
The necessary conditions for a subset \(H\) of \(G\) to be a subgroup of \(G\) are:
<ol>
	<li>\(H\) is not empty</li>
	<li>\(H\) is closed under multiplication. That is, for all elements \(h_1\) and \(h_2\) of \(H\), the products \(h_1h_2\) is also an element of \(H\)</li>
	<li>\(H\) is closed under inverses. For all \(h \in H\), the inverse \(h^{-1}\) is an element of \(H\)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<br>
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>\(H\) is associative. For any \(a,b,c \in H\), \((ab)c = a(bc)\). We're inheriting the same operation from \(G\) so \(H\) must be associative.</li>
	<li>\(H\) has an identity element: We know \(H\) is non-empty by (1). We also know for any \(h \in H\), \(h^{-1} \in H\) by (3). By (2), \(H\) is closed under multiplication so \(hh^{-1} \in H\) but \(hh^{-1} = e\) so the identity element is in \(H\).  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
Consider the group $$G = S_4$$ permutations of $$\{1,2,3,4\}$$. The order of this group is $$|G| = 4$$. The following are subgroups of $$S_4$$:
<ul>
	<li>\(H=\{ \sigma \in S_4 \ | \ \sigma(4) = 4\}\). So this subgroup fixes \(4\) in the permutation. \(|H| = 3! = 6\). In fact, it is permuting only 3 numbers and it is isomorphic to \(S_3\).</li>
	<li>\(H'=\{e,(1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4), (1 \ 4)(2 \ 3)\}\). It's not empty. It has the identity element. Every element is its own inverse. The one thing not too obvious is proving it is closed. This subgroup is isomorphic to the symmetry group of the rectangle.</li>
	<li>\(H''=\{e,(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4)(4 \ 3 \ 2 \ 1), (1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4), (1 \ 4)(2 \ 3), (1 \ 3),(2 \ 4)\}\). This one is isomorphic to \(D_4\) which is the symmetries of the square.</li>

<h4><b>Generated Subgroups</b></h4>
Before talking about subgroups we need the following lemma
<br>
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Lemma (Book Proposition 2.2.8)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(H_1, H_2,...,H_n\) be subgroups of \(G\). Then \(H = H_1 \cap H_2 \ \cap ... \cap \ H_n \) is a subgroup of \(G\). More generally, if \(\{H_{\alpha}\}\) is any collection of subgroups, then \(\cap_{\alpha}\) is a subgroup.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
</div>
<br>
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
The intersection must have the identity element. The intersection is closed under the operation because for any two elements $$a, b \in H$$, their product $$ab \in H$$ and since $$a, b$$ is in the intersection, then they are in every $$H_i$$ group. Same argument for the inverse. 
<br>
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(S\) be a subset of \(G\). Then
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \langle S \rangle = \bigcap_{\text{all } H_i \leq G \text{ such that } S \subseteq H_i}
	\end{align*}
	$$
<ul>
<li>\(\langle S \rangle\) is the intersection of all subgroups such that \(S\) is a subset of each subgroup \(H_i\).</li>
<li>\(\langle S \rangle\) is called <b>the subgroup generated by</b> \(S\) and it is the smallest subgroup in \(G\) that contains \(S\).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<br>
<br>
It is the smallest group because by definition for any $$H \leq G$$, we have $$S \subseteq H$$. So $$\langle S \rangle \subseteq H$$ for any $$H$$. Additionally from the book we have
<ul>
<li>If \(S\) contains a single element, \(S = \{a\}\), then the subgroup generated by \(S\) is denoted by \(\langle a \rangle\). </li>
<li>If \(G = \langle S \rangle\), then \(G\) is generated by \(S\) or \(S\) generates \(G\)</li>
</ul>
Another way to describe $$\langle S \rangle$$ is take a bottom up approach to describe the elements.
<br>
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Suppose \(G\) is a group and \(S\) is a subset of \(G\). Then
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \langle S \rangle = \{e\} \cup \{g_1g_2...g_k\} \ | \ k \geq 1, \forall i,..,k \ g_i \in S \text{ or } g_i^{-1} \in S
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<br>
<br>
In other words, $$\langle S \rangle$$ is that it contains all the possible products $$g_1g_2...g_n$$ where $$g_i \in S$$ or $$g_i^{-1} \in S$$. The set that contains these words $$\{e\} \cup \{g_1g_2...g_k\}$$ is often called the "set of words in $$S$$" in group theory.
<br>
<br>
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
Let $$T$$ be the set of words. We need to check that 
<ul>
	<li>\(S \subseteq T\). [This is true because all the words of length 1 make up the set \(S\).]</li>
	<li>\(T\) is a subgroup of \(G\). [This is true because \(T\) has the identity element. For any two word, the product of these is just a longer word which is also in \(T\). It is closed under the inverses because \((g_1g_2...g_k) = g_k^{-1}...g_1^{-1}\).]</li>
	<li>If \(H \leq G\) and \(S \subseteq H\), then \(T \subseteq H\). [This is true because if \(H\) contains \(S\) then it must contain all the inverses of these words and then also the products of all of these words since it's group (closed) so it has all of these elements and it contains \(T\).]</li>
</ul>
These three conditions imply that $$T = \langle S \rangle$$. We'll use this proposition a lot. 
<br>
<br>
Some Examples 
<ul>
	<li>\(\langle (1 \ 2) \rangle = \{e, (1 \ 2)\}\). This says that the subgroup generated by \(\{(1 \ 2)\}\) is \(\{e, (1 \ 2)\} = \langle (1 \ 2) \rangle \)</li>
	<li>\(\langle (1 \ 2 \ 3) \rangle = \{e, (1 \ 2 \ 3), (1 \ 3 \ 2)\}\)</li>
	<li>\(G = S_3 = \langle (1 \ 2), (1 \ 2 \ 3) \rangle\). So \(S_3\) is generated by </li>

<h4><b>Cyclic Groups and Cyclic Subgroups</b></h4>



<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2.2.9
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(a\) be an element of a group \(G\). The subgroup \(\langle a \rangle\) generated by \(a\) is \(\{a^k \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}\).
</div>
<br>
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
Let $$H = \{a^k \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}$$. We will show that $$\langle a \rangle = H$$ as follows:
<br>
<br>
$$\langle a \rangle \subseteq H$$: We know that $$G$$ is a group and $$H$$ is subset of $$G$$. We claim that it is a subgroup of $$G$$. It is closed under multiplication because for any $$a^k$$ and $$a^l$$ in $$H$$, $$a^{k+l} \in H$$. It is closed under inverses because for any $$a^k \in H$$, $$(a^{k})^-1 = a^{-k} \in H$$. Furthermore, $$H$$ contains $$a$$ and since $$H$$ is a subgroup, then $$H$$ contains all the powers of $$a$$. Therefore, $$\langle a \rangle \subseteq H$$. 
<br>
<br>
$$H \subseteq \langle a \rangle$$: We showed that $$H = \{a^k \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}$$ is a subgroup above. It is closed under multiplication and so it contains all powers of $$a$$. Therefore, $$H \subseteq \langle a \rangle$$. $$\ \blacksquare$$ 
<br>
<br>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition 2.2.10
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(a\) be an element of a group \(G\). The set \(\langle a \rangle = \{a^k \ : \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}\) of powers of \(a\) is called the <b>cyclic subgroup generated by</b> \(a\). If there is an element \(a \in G\) such that \(\langle a \rangle = G\), we say that \(G\) is a <b>cyclic group</b>. We say that \(a\) is a <b>generator</b> of the cyclic group
</div>
<br>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
Suppose $$G = \mathbf{Z}$$ with the addition operator. For any element $$d \in \mathbf{Z}$$, the set of powers of $$d$$ is the set of all multiples of $$d$$ since the group operation is addition. So $$d+d+d+d+d$$ is the fifth power for example. We see here that $$\langle d \rangle = d \mathbf{Z} = \{nd \ : \ n \in \mathbf{Z}\}$$ is a cyclic subgroup of $$\mathbf{Z}$$. In fact, $$\mathbf{Z}$$ itself is cyclic. 
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><b>The Order of a Cyclic Subgroup</b></h4>
A cyclic subgroup could be infinite or finite. When the powers of $$a$$ are all distinct, it's infinite. Otherwise, it is not. The following definition formalizes this.
<br>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition 2.2.16
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
The <b>order</b> of the cyclic subgroup generated by \(a\) is called <b>the order of </b>\(a\). We denote the order of \(a\) by \(o(a)\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
When the order of $$a$$ is finite, then two powers of $$a$$ will coincide at some point. Suppose that $$k < l$$, and $$a^k = a^l$$, then $$a^{l-k} = e$$. This implies that some positive integer of $$a$$ is the identity element. Let $$n$$ be the least positive integer such that $$a^n = e$$. This means that $$e, a, a^2,...a^{n-1}$$ are all distinct (Why? TODO). Write $$k = mn + r$$. Therefore,
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 a^{k} &= a^{mn+r} \\
	       &= a^{mn}a^r \\
		   &= e^{m}a^r \\
		   &= a^r
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
This means that $$a^k = a^l$$ if and only if $$k$$ and $$l$$ have the same remainder upon division of $$n$$, that is $$k \equiv l \mod n$$. This leads to the following proposition
<br>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2.2.17
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
If the order of \(a\) is finite, then it is the least positive integer \(n\) such that \(a^n = e\). Furthermore, \(\langle a \rangle = \{a^k \ : \ 0 \leq k < o(a)\}\)
</div>
<br>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
What is the order of $$[5]$$ in $$\phi(14)$$? We know $$[5]^2 = [11]$$, $$[5]^3 = [13]$$ because $$5^3 = 125 \mod 14 = 13$$. $$[5]^4 = [9]$$, $$[5]^5 = 3$$ and finally $$[5]^6 = [1]$$. So the order of $$[5]$$ is 6. 
<br>
<br>
The following result shows that in fact any two cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic!
<br>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2.2.20
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(a\) be an element of a group \(G\).
<ol type="a">
	<li>If \(a\) has infinte order, then \(\langle a \rangle\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}\)</li>
	<li>If \(a\) has finite order, then \(\langle a \rangle\) is isomorphic to the group \(\mathbf{Z}_n\)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<br>
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
For $$(a)$$, we want to show this by finding an example of a isomorphism. So define the map $$\varphi \ : \ \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \langle a \rangle$$ by $$\varphi(k) = a^k$$. To show that this map is an isomorphism, we need to show that it is a bijection and also that for any two elements $$a, b \in \mathbf{Z}$$, $$\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)$$ (Definition 2.1.13).
<br>
<br>
To show that it is a bijection, observe that this map is surjective or onto by the definition of $$\langle a \rangle$$. (Recall that that $$\langle a \rangle$$ is of infinite order). It is also injective or 1-1 because all the elements of $$\langle a \rangle$$ (powers of $$a$$) are distinct. Furthermore, see that $$\varphi(k + l) = a^{k+l} = a^ka^k$$. So $$\varphi$$ is an isomorphism.
<br>
<br>
Similarly for $$(b)$$, we want to define an isomorphism. Note here that both $$\mathbf{Z}_n$$ and $$\langle a \rangle$$ have $$n$$ elements so define the map $$\varphi \ : \ \mathbf{Z}_n \rightarrow \langle a \rangle$$ by $$\varphi([k]) = a^k$$ where $$ 0 \leq k \leq n-1$$. In $$\mathbf{Z}_n$$, the addition of $$[k]$$ and $$[l]$$ is $$[r]$$ where $$r$$ is the remainder after dividing $$k+l$$ by $$n$$. While the multiplication in $$\langle a \rangle$$ is given by $$a^ka^l = a^{k+l} = a^r$$ where $$r$$ is also the remainder after dividing $$k+l$$ by $$n$$ as we saw earlier. Therefore $$\varphi$$ is an isomorphism.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><b>Subgroups of Cyclic Groups</b></h4>
Every cyclic group is isomorphic to $$\mathbf{Z}$$ or $$\mathbf{Z}_n$$. Therefore, we'll determine the subgroups of $$\mathbf{Z}$$ and $$\mathbf{Z}_n$$ to determine all the subgroups of cyclic groups.
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2.2.21
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
<ol type="a">
	<li>Let \(H\) be a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}\). Then either \(H = \{0\}\) or there is a unique \(d \in \mathbf{N}\) such that \(H = \langle d \rangle = d\mathbf{Z}\)</li>
	<li>If \(d \in \mathbf{N}\), then \(d\mathbf{Z} \cong \mathbf{Z}\).</li>
	<li>If \(a, b \in \mathbf{N}\), then \(a\mathbf{Z} \subseteq b\mathbf{Z}\) if and only if \(b\) divides \(a\).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<br>
As a reminder, $$d\mathbf{Z} = \{ dn \ | \ n \in \mathbf{Z}\}$$. It is the subgroup generated by $$d$$.
<br>
<br>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
For $$(c)$$:<br>
$$\Rightarrow$$: If $$a\mathbf{Z} \subseteq b\mathbf{Z}$$, then $$a$$ is a multiple of $$b$$. So $$b$$ divides $$a$$. <br>
$$\Leftarrow$$: If $$b$$ divides $$a$$, then $$a \in b\mathbf{Z}$$ so $$a\mathbf{Z} \subseteq b\mathbf{Z}$$.
<br>
<br>
For $$(a)$$:<br>
Suppose $$H$$ is a subgroup of $$\mathbf{Z}$$. Since $$H$$ is a subgroup, then it must contain at least one element. Suppose $$H \neq \{0\}$$, then $$H$$ contains a nonzero integer. For any integer $$a \in H$$, $$H$$ must also contain $$-a$$. Let $$d$$ be the smallest element in $$H \cap \mathbf{N}$$. We claim that $$H = d\mathbf{Z}$$. We want to show that $$H \subseteq d\mathbf{Z}$$ and $$d\mathbf{Z} \subseteq H$$.
<br>
<br>
Let $$h \in H$$. If $$h = d$$, then since $$d \in H$$, we have $$\langle d \rangle = d\mathbf{Z} \subseteq H$$. Otherwise, we can write $$h = qd + r$$ where $$0 \leq r < d$$. Now, we know that $$h \in H$$ and we know that $$qd \ \in H$$ since it's a multiple of $$d$$, so $$r = h + (- qd) = h - qd \in H$$. But $$d$$ is the least positive element of $$H$$ and $$r < d$$. So we have $$r = 0$$. Therefore, $$h = qd \in d\mathbf{Z}$$.
<br>
<br>
So we know that there exists a $$d \in \mathbf{N}$$ such that $$d\mathbf{Z} = H$$. To see that it's unique, suppose that $$d' \in H$$ and so $$d'\mathbf{Z} = H$$ but by (c), $$d$$ and $$d'$$ divide one another and since they're both positive then $$d = d'$$ so $$d$$ is unique. $$\ \blacksquare$$. 
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Corollary 2.2.22

Every subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}\) other than \({0}\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}\).

Lemma 2.2.23
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(n \geq 2\) and let \(d\) be a positive divisor of \(n\). The cyclic subgroup \(\langle [d] \rangle\) generated by \([d]\) in \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) has cardinality \(|\langle [d] \rangle| = n/d\)
</div>
<br>
Reminder: The subgroup generated by $$d$$ is $$\{...,-2d,-d,0,d,2d,...\}$$. The order of this subgroup is clearly infinite. The subgroup generated by $$[d]$$ is $$\{[0], [d], [2d],...,(k-1)[d]\}$$ where $$(k+1)[d] = 0$$. This group is clearly finite. 
<br>
<br>
Example: Suppose $$d=3$$ and $$n=9$$. $$Z_9 = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$$ The cyclic subgroup in $$Z_9$$ generated by $$\langle [3] \rangle$$ is $$\{k[3] \mod 9 \ | \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\} = \{[0],[3],[6]\}$$. The size of $$\langle [3] \rangle$$ is $$n/d = 9/3 = 3$$.
<br>
<br>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
We are given that $$d$$ is a positive divisor of $$n$$. Since we're working with addition, this means that for some multiple of $$d$$, we will get back to $$[0]$$. So let $$s$$ be the least positive integer such that $$s[d] = [0]$$. In other words, $$sd \equiv 0 \mod n$$. This implies that $$sd$$ is a multiple of $$n$$ so $$sd = kn$$ for some integer $$k$$. But since we need the smallest $$s$$, then $$s = \frac{n}{d}$$. $$\ \blacksquare$$

<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2.2.24
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(H\) be a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}_n\).
<ol type="a">
	<li>Either \(H = \{0\}\), or there is a \(d > 0\) such that \(H = \langle [d] \rangle\)</li>
	<li>If \(d\) is the smallest of positive integers \(s\) such that \(H\) = \(\langle [s] \rangle\), then \(d|H| = n\)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<br>
Example $$(a)$$: Let $$H$$ be a subgroup of $$Z_9$$. $$H$$ must be generated by some $$d > 0$$. For example $$Z_9$$ is generated by $$H = \langle [1] \rangle$$. $$\{[0],[3],[6]\}$$ is generated by $$\langle [3] \rangle$$ and so on. 
<br>
<br>
Example $$(b)$$: Take $$s = 6$$ such that $$H = \langle [6] \rangle = \{[0], [6], [3]\}$$. But $$d = 3$$ is the smallest generator for this subgroup because $$\langle [3] \rangle = \{[0], [3], [6]\}$$.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
For (a), suppose $$H \neq \{[0]\}$$. Then $$H$$ contains at least one equivalent such that it is not $$[0]$$. Let $$[d]$$ be the smallest positive equivalent class. We claim that $$H = \langle [d] \rangle$$. So we need to show that $$\langle [d] \rangle \subseteq H$$ and $$H \subseteq \langle [d] \rangle$$.
<br>
<br>
$$\langle [d] \rangle \subseteq H$$: Since $$[d] \in H$$, then by definition, $$\langle [d] \rangle \subseteq H$$.
<br>
<br>
$$H \subseteq \langle [d] \rangle$$. Suppose $$[h] \in H$$, then by the division algorithm we can find $$q$$ and $$r$$ such that
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 [h] = [qd] + [r]
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
We know that $$[h] \in H$$ and $$[qd] \in H$$. Since $$H$$ is closed under addition, then
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 [r] = [h] - [qd]
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
is also in $$H$$. But since $$[d]$$ was the smallest positive equivalent class, then $$[r]=0$$ and we must have $$[h] = [qd]$$. Therefore, $$[h] \in \langle [d] \rangle$$. From this we see that $$H = \langle [d] \rangle$$ as we wanted to show.
<br>
<br>
For $$(b)$$, suppose that $$H = \langle [s] \rangle$$ and $$d$$ is the smallest of the positive integers $$s$$ so $$[d]$$ also generates $$H$$. By the division algorithm, write $$n = qd + r$$ where $$0 \leq r < d$$. Now
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 [n] &= [qd + r] \\
	 0 &= [qd] + [r] \\
	 [r] &= -[qd] \\
	     &= -q[d] \\
