Now, given a particular \(n_0 \in \mathbf{N}\), then in \(K_{n_0}\), we will get the terms starting at \(n \geq n_0\) from the sequence \((x_n)\). So take these terms to form a subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) contained completely in \(K_{n_0}\). This subsequence converges to \(x\) and \(x \in K_{n_0}\). Since \(n_0\) was arbitrary, then \(x \in \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} K_n\) and we’re done. \(\blacksquare\)

  (Theorem 3.3.4) (Characterization of Compactness in R) A set \(K \in \mathbf{R}\) is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>\(\Rightarrow\): Assume a set \(K\) is compact. We’ll prove that \(K\) is closed and bounded. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(K\) is not a bounded set. The definition of a compact set states that every sequence \((a_n)\) in \(K\) has a subsequence \(a_{n_k}\) that converges to a limit that is also in \(K\). So the idea is to derive a contradiction from finding some sequence that grows to infinity in a way that it cannot have a convergent subsequence. Since \(K\) is not a bounded set, then there must exists an element \(x_1 \in K\) such that \(|x_1| &gt; 1\). Similarly, there must exists some element \(x_2 \in K\) with \(x_2 &gt; 2\). In general, given any \(n \in \mathbf{N}\), we can produce \(x_n \in K\) such that \(|x_n| &gt; n\). \(x_1, x_2, ... x_n, ... = (x_n)\) is a sequence in \(K\). Since \(K\) is compact, then there must exist a convergent subsequence \((x_{n_k})\). But all the elements in \((x_{n_k})\) must satisfy \(|x_{n_k}| &gt; n_k\) (why? see <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/02/10/analysis-seq-subsequences.html">this</a>) and consequently \((x_{n_k})\) is unbounded. But <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/12/analysis-seq-if-convergent-then-bounded.html">theorem 2.3.2</a> states that convergent sequences must bounded. Therefore, we’ve arrived at a contradiction and \(K\) must be a bounded set.
<br />
<br />
To show that \(K\) is closed, we must show that it includes all of its limit points. Suppose \(x\) is a limit point of \(K\) such that \((x_n) \rightarrow x\) and \((x_n)\) is contained in \(K\). We will show that \(x \in K\). Since \(K\) is compact, then \((x_n)\) must have a convergent subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) with its limit is in \(K\). But by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/11/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence.html">theorem 2.5.2</a>, subsequences of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit and so \((x_n)\) must converge to the same limit in \(K\). Therefore \(K\) is closed as we wanted to show.
<br /><br /></p>

(Theorem 3.3.4) (Characterization of Compactness in R) A set \(K \in \mathbf{R}\) is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Proof \(\Rightarrow\): Assume a set \(K\) is compact. We’ll prove that \(K\) is closed and bounded. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(K\) is not a bounded set. The definition of a compact set states that every sequence \((a_n)\) in \(K\) has a subsequence \(a_{n_k}\) that converges to a limit that is also in \(K\). So the idea is to derive a contradiction from finding some sequence that grows to infinity in a way that it cannot have a convergent subsequence. Since \(K\) is not a bounded set, then there must exists an element \(x_1 \in K\) such that \(|x_1| &gt; 1\). Similarly, there must exists some element \(x_2 \in K\) with \(x_2 &gt; 2\). In general, given any \(n \in \mathbf{N}\), we can produce \(x_n \in K\) such that \(|x_n| &gt; n\). \(x_1, x_2, ... x_n, ... = (x_n)\) is a sequence in \(K\). Since \(K\) is compact, then there must exist a convergent subsequence \((x_{n_k})\). But all the elements in \((x_{n_k})\) must satisfy \(|x_{n_k}| &gt; n_k\) (why? see this) and consequently \((x_{n_k})\) is unbounded. But theorem 2.3.2 states that convergent sequences must bounded. Therefore, we’ve arrived at a contradiction and \(K\) must be a bounded set. To show that \(K\) is closed, we must show that it includes all of its limit points. Suppose \(x\) is a limit point of \(K\) such that \((x_n) \rightarrow x\) and \((x_n)\) is contained in \(K\). We will show that \(x \in K\). Since \(K\) is compact, then \((x_n)\) must have a convergent subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) with its limit is in \(K\). But by theorem 2.5.2, subsequences of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit and so \((x_n)\) must converge to the same limit in \(K\). Therefore \(K\) is closed as we wanted to show.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Compact Sets</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/07/01/analysis-sets-compact.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Compact Sets" /><published>2024-07-01T01:01:36-07:00</published><updated>2024-07-01T01:01:36-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/07/01/analysis-sets-compact</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/07/01/analysis-sets-compact.html"><![CDATA[<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">

  (Theorem 3.2.13) A set \(O\) is open if and only if \(O^c\) is closed. Likewise, a set \(F\) is closed if and only if \(F^c\) is open.
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>Let \(O \in \mathbf{R}\) be an open set. We need to prove that \(O^c\) is a closed set. To do so, we need to show that \(O^c\) contains all of its limit points. Let \(x\) be an arbitrary limit point of \(O^c\). Now suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(x \notin O^c\) so \(x \in O\). By the definition of an open set, this means that there exists some \(\delta\)-neighborhood, \(V_{\delta}(x)\), of \(x\) such that \(V_{\delta}(x) \subseteq O\). By the definition of a limit point, there exists a sequence \((a_n)\) such that \((a_n) \rightarrow x\) and \(a_n \in O^c\) and \(x\) is not a term of the sequence. This implies that for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), we must have an \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that when \(n &gt; N\), \(|a_n - x| \leq \epsilon\). But if we set \(\epsilon = \delta\), then \(a_n \in (x - \delta, x + \delta)\). This means that \((a_n)\) could not possibly converge since the terms in that interval are in \(O\) and not \(O^c\) because we earlier said that \(V_{\delta}(x) \subseteq O\). This is a contradiction and so \(x \in O\).
<br />
<br />
For the other direction. Suppose that \(O^c\) is closed. We need to prove that \(O\) is open. Then by the definition of an open set, given an element \(x \in O\), we need to produce an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood of \(x\) such that \(V_{\epsilon}(x) \subseteq O\). Since we assumed that \(O^c\) is closed, then \(O^c\) must contains all of its limits points and so \(x\) is not a limit point of \(O^c\). The definition of a limit point states that if \(x\) was a limit point, then every \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood of \(x\) intersects \(O^c\) at some point other than \(x\) but \(x\) is not a limit point of \(O^c\) and so there exists some \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\) that doesn’t intersect \(O^c\) and therefore \(V_{\epsilon}(x) \in O\).
<br />
<br />
For the second statement, it follows from the fact that \((O^c)^c = O\). \(\blacksquare\)

</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>Let \(A\) be a set subset of \(\mathbf{R}\) and let \(L\) be the set of its limit points. By definition \(\overline{A} = A \cup L\). To prove that \(\overline{A}\) is closed, we’ll start by proving that \(L\) is closed. To do so, let \(x\) be a limit point of \(L\). We need to prove that \(x \in L\). Since \(x\) is a limit point of \(L\) this means that given \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), every \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood \(V_{\epsilon/2}(x)\) of \(x\) intersects \(L\) at some element \(y\) such that \(x \neq y\). But this implies that \(y\) is a limit point of \(A\) (since \(L\) is the set of \(A\)’s limit points). Again by the definition of a limit point, this means that given \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), every \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood \(V_{\epsilon/2}(y)\) of \(y\) intersects \(A\) at some element \(z\) such that \(y \neq z\). So now we have \(x\) and \(z\) within a distance of at most \(\epsilon\) of each other. In other words,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|x - z| &amp;= |x - y + y - z| \\
&amp;\leq |x - y| + |y - z| \quad \text{(by the triangle inequality)} \\
&amp;&lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>From this we can conclude that \(z\) is an element of \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\). But \(z\) is an element of \(A\). So this means that \(z\) is an element of \(V_{\epsilon}(x) \cap A\). Next, we want to show that \(x \neq z\). If we do that, then this means that \(x\) is a limit point of \(A\) which will imply that \(x\) is a limit point of \(L\). So,

<p>Let \(A\) be \(\{1/n: n \in \mathbf{N}\}\). We know that a point \(x=1/n\) is a limit point of a set \(A\) if every \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood \(V_{\epsilon}(1/n)\) of \(1/n\) intersects \(A\) at some point other than \(x\). Set \(\epsilon = 1/n - 1/(n + 1)\). Then</p>

We know that a point \(x=1/n\) is a limit point of a set \(A\) if every \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood \(V_{\epsilon}(1/n)\) of \(1/n\) intersects \(A\) at some point other than \(x\). Set \(\epsilon = 1/n - 1/(n + 1)\). Then $$ \begin{align*} V_{\epsilon}(1/n) \cap A = \{\frac{1}{n}\}. \end{align*} $$ So this means that \(1/n\) is not a limit point and is an isolated point instead. The only limit point of \(A\) is in fact 0 and so \(\overline{A} = A \cup \{0\}\).

  Prove that a closed interval \([c,d] = \{c \leq x \leq d\}\) is a closed set.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>Let \([c,d] = \{c \leq x \leq d\}\) be a closed interval. To prove that it’s a closed set, we need to prove that \([c,d]\) contains all of its limit points so let \(x\) be an arbitrary limit point. By the definition of a limit point, we know that there must exist a sequence \((x_n)\) such that \((x_n) \rightarrow x\). We need to show that \(x \in [c,d]\). 
By the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/02/analysis-seq-order-limit-theorem.html">order limit theorem (iii)</a>, since \(c \leq x_n \leq d\) for all \(n \in \mathbf{N}\) it follows that \(c \leq x \leq d\) as well. Therefore, \([c,d]\) is closed as required. \(\blacksquare\).
