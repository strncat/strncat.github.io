<h3>Problem Discussion:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
This was really tricky. We are given a sequence and to find its limit, the idea here is to extract a subsequence and then concluding that it also converges to the same limit as the original sequence by theorem 2.5.2 which says that subsequences of a convergent sequence converge to the same limit as the original sequence. But then we can also find the limit of the subsequence using a differen path. So'll end up with two limits for the same subsequence. This is impossible since limits are unique and this will give us a direct us. This final answer is only the limit of the subsequence but also the limit of the sequence itself.

<h3>Proof:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
Let $$(b^n)$$ is the sequence defined above. This sequence is decreasing and bounded below by definition. By the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/04/29/analysis-seq-monotone-convergence-theorem.html">monotone convergence theorem</a>, $$(b^n)$$ convergences to some number $$l$$ such that $$b &gt; l \geq 0$$. To compute $$l$$, let $$(b^{2n})$$ be a subsequence of $$(b^n)$$. The terms of $$(b^{2n})$$ are
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
b^2 &gt; b^4 &gt; b^6 &gt; ... &gt; 0.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
Since $$(b^{2n})$$ is a subsequence of $$(b^n)$$, then by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/11/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence.html">theorem 2.5.2</a>, we must have that $$(b^{2n}) \rightarrow l$$. 
<br /><br />
But, note that $$b^{2n} = b^nb^n$$. So we can use the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/01/analysis-seq-algebraic-limit-theorem-iii.html">algebraic limit theorem</a> to conclude that $$(b^{2n}) \rightarrow l*l = l^2$$. So now we arrived at two results. First $$(b^{2n}) \rightarrow l$$ and now $$(b^{2n}) \rightarrow l^2$$. But we know that the limit of a sequence is unique from <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/04/27/analysis-seq-limits-unique.html">uniqueness of limits theorem (2.2.7)</a>, so we must have that $$l^2 = l$$ and therefore $$l = 0$$.
