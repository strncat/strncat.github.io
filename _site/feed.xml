<h4><b>Problem Discussion</b></h4>
<p>We’ll follow a similar approach to proving the example in <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/04/analysis-seq-sqrt.html">here</a>. We want to show that \((\sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n})\) converges to 0, so we need to find \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\),</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} - 0 \rvert &lt; \epsilon \quad \text{whenever $n &gt; N$}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>since \(\sqrt{n + 1} &gt; \sqrt{n}\), we can drop the absolute value and then we’ll use the trick of multiplying by the conjugate.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} \rvert &amp;&lt; \epsilon \\
\left(\frac{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}}\right) \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} &amp;&lt; \epsilon \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}} &amp;&lt; \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We need to remember here that we’re trying to find an \(n\) that would make the above inequality true. So we want to solve for \(n\). but it’s not easy since we have \(\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}\) in the denominator. What can we do to simplify this? The goal here is that want to keep this term under \(\epsilon\) so instead of focusing on the term itself, we could maybe find a slightly bigger term that is easier to work with. For example we can simplify the bound to:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}} &amp;&lt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{n} + \sqrt{n}} \\
&amp;&lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>\((\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}})\) is slightly bigger than the original term and so we’re getting an even bigger term to be less than \(\epsilon\) so this definitely works.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}} &amp;&lt; \epsilon \\
\frac{1}{2\epsilon} &amp;&lt; \sqrt{n} \\
\sqrt{n} &amp;&gt; \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \\
n &amp;&gt; \frac{1}{4\epsilon^2}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So now if we let \(n\) be greater than \(N = \frac{1}{4\epsilon^2}\), we’ll get the bound that we want \(\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} \rvert &lt; \epsilon\). In the formal proof, we’ll have to walk backwards.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Formal Proof</b></h4>
<p>To show that \((\sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n})\) converges to 0, let \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) be arbitrary. We want to prove that there exists some \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that when \(n &gt; N\),</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} - 0\rvert &lt; \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Pick \(N = \frac{1}{4\epsilon^2}\). We now verify that this choice is appropriate. Let \(n &gt; N\). Then,</p>

<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} \rvert \\
\left(\frac{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}}\right) \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n + 1} + \sqrt{n}} &amp;&lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>But we know since \(n &gt; N\) then \(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}} &lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{N}}\) and so</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}} &lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{N}} &amp;&lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\frac{1}{4\epsilon^2}}} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\frac{2}{2\epsilon}} \\
&amp;= \epsilon. \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>and we \(\lvert \sqrt{n + 1} - \sqrt{n} \rvert \leq \epsilon\) as desired. \(\blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Problem Discussion:</b></h4>
<p>This is a great theorem because we’re saying that given any sequence whether convergent or divergent, we can still extract a convergent subsequence from it. For example if we’re given the sequence \(\{0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,.....\}\) which clearly won’t converge, we can still make up the subsequence \(\{0,0,0,0,....\}\) which clearly converges to 0. But how do we prove this? This proof relies on the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/04/30/analysis-nested-internval-property.html">nested interval property</a> which states that the intersection a nested sequence of closed intervals is non-empty. We will construct a subsequence from having many nested intervals and then we’ll use the nested sequence property to conclude something about its convergence.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \((a_n)\) be a bounded sequence. By <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/03/analysis-seq-bounded.html">theorem 2.3.1</a>, we know that there exists a number \(M &gt; 0\) satisfying \(|a_n| \leq M\) for all \(n \in \mathbf{N}\). We will bisect this closed interval \([-M,M]\) into two closed intervals \([-M,0]\) and \([0,M]\) noting here that the mid point belongs to both intervals. Now, \((a_n)\) has infinitely many terms by definition. So one of these halfs must contain an infinite number of terms of the sequence \((a_n)\). Let this interval be \(I_1\) (Choose the left half if both had infinitely many terms).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/real-analysis/bolzano-0.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Now, we’re construct a subsequence from \((a_n)\). The first term \(a_{n_1}\) will an arbitrary element chosen from \(I_1\) so \(a_n \in I_1\). Bisect \(I_1\) again into two intervals and let \(I_2\) be the interval containing infinite terms (there should be at least one).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/real-analysis/bolzano-1.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Let \(a_{n_2}\) be chosen from \(I_2\) such that \(n_2 &gt; n_1\) (Side Note: Remember that \(n_2\) indicates the positon of the element in the subsequence. We can choose \(n_2\) to be bigger than \(n_1\) because \(I_2\) has infinitely many terms so even if \(a_{n_1}\) was really big like \(a_{3435453...}\), we can still find a bigger subscript since there are infinitely many terms. Moreover, our sequence is not monotone so we don’t need to worry about picking an element from the right half before the left half. This doesn’t matter. We only care about respecting the order of the elements in the sequence). 
<br />
<br />
Next, we’re going to bisect \(I_2\) in the same way and choose \(I_3\) to be the half with infinitely many terms.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/real-analysis/bolzano-2.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>In general, we will construct the closed interval \(I_k\) by taking the half of interval \(I_{k-1}\) that contains infinitely many terms. We will then construct a subsequence \((a_{n_k})\) such that \(a_k \in I_k\) and</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
n_k &gt; n_{k-1} &gt; ... &gt; n_2 &gt; n_1.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Now, we want to prove that \((a_{n_k})\) is a convergent subsequence. To do so, we need to find a candidate for limit. We do know by construction that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq I_3 \supseteq ...
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This forms a nested sequence of closed intervals and so by the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/04/30/analysis-nested-internval-property.html">Nested Interval Property</a>, there exits at least one point \(x \in \mathbf{R}\) such that it is contained in every interval \(I_k\). So let’s prove that \((a_{n_k}) \rightarrow x\).
<br />
<br />
Let \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) be arbitrary chosen. We will show that there exists a number \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that for any \(k \geq N\), we have</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	|a_{n_k} - x| \leq \epsilon.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>To see this, we know by construction that the length of interval \(I_k\) is \(M(1/2)^{k-1}\). But we also know that \((M(1/2)^{k-1}) \rightarrow 0\) (TODO: link). This means that the intervals are getting smaller and smaller until the length of these intervals converges to 0. So in this case, just choose \(N\) such that when \(k \geq N\), the length of interval \(I_k\) is less than \(\epsilon\). Even though we chose the intervals to have length less than \(\epsilon\), we still have \(a_{n_k} \in I_k\) by construction and we still have \(x \in I_k\) by the Nested Interval Property. But since the interval length is less than \(\epsilon\), then the distance between \(a_{n_k}\) and \(x\) must be less than \(\epsilon\) or in other words \(|a_{n_k} - x| \leq \epsilon\) as wanted to show. Therefore, \((a_{n_k}) \rightarrow x\). \(\blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Problem Discussion:</b></h4>
<p>This was really tricky. We are given a sequence and to find its limit, the idea here is to extract a subsequence and then concluding that it also converges to the same limit as the original sequence by theorem 2.5.2 which says that subsequences of a convergent sequence converge to the same limit as the original sequence. But then we can also find the limit of the subsequence using a differen path. So’ll end up with two limits for the same subsequence. This is impossible since limits are unique and this will give us a direct us. This final answer is only the limit of the subsequence but also the limit of the sequence itself.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof:</b></h4>
<p>Let \((b^n)\) is the sequence defined above. This sequence is decreasing and bounded below by definition. By the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/04/29/analysis-seq-monotone-convergence-theorem.html">monotone convergence theorem</a>, \((b^n)\) convergences to some number \(l\) such that \(b &gt; l \geq 0\). To compute \(l\), let \((b^{2n})\) be a subsequence of \((b^n)\). The terms of \((b^{2n})\) are</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
b^2 &gt; b^4 &gt; b^6 &gt; ... &gt; 0.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Since \((b^{2n})\) is a subsequence of \((b^n)\), then by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/11/analysis-seq-subseq-convergence.html">theorem 2.5.2</a>, we must have that \((b^{2n}) \rightarrow l\). 
<br /><br />
But, note that \(b^{2n} = b^nb^n\). So we can use the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/01/analysis-seq-algebraic-limit-theorem-iii.html">algebraic limit theorem</a> to conclude that \((b^{2n}) \rightarrow l*l = l^2\). So now we arrived at two results. First \((b^{2n}) \rightarrow l\) and now \((b^{2n}) \rightarrow l^2\). But we know that the limit of a sequence is unique from <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/04/27/analysis-seq-limits-unique.html">uniqueness of limits theorem (2.2.7)</a>, so we must have that \(l^2 = l\) and therefore \(l = 0\).</p>

But we know that the limit of a sequence is unique from uniqueness of limits theorem (2.2.7), so we must have that \(l^2 = l\) and therefore \(l = 0\).]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Convergent Sequences are bounded [2.3.2]</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/12/analysis-seq-if-convergent-then-bounded.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Convergent Sequences are bounded [2.3.2]" /><published>2024-06-12T01:01:36-07:00</published><updated>2024-06-12T01:01:36-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/12/analysis-seq-if-convergent-then-bounded</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/12/analysis-seq-if-convergent-then-bounded.html"><![CDATA[<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">

<h4><b>Definition: Series</b></h4>
<p>A sequence is defined in the book as a function whose domain in \(\mathbf{N}\) (see <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/21/analysis-seq-definitions.html">this</a>). A series is defined as follows:</p>
<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">
  Let \((b_n)\) be a sequence. A <i>infinite series</i> is a formal expression of the form
  $$
  \begin{align*}
  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n = b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 + ...
  \end{align*}
  $$
</div>
<p><br />
Here is another definition that I found online:</p>
<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">
  A Series is a function from the set of infinite sequences to the set of numbers.
</div>
<p><br />
I’ve also seen that a series is simply a <i>sum</i> while a sequence is a <i>list</i>.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Definition: Convergence of a Series</b></h4>
<p>When does a given series converge?</p>
<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">
  Let \((b_n)\) be a sequence and let the infinite series be of the form
  $$
  \begin{align*}
  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n = b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 + ...
  \end{align*}
  $$
We define the corresponding sequence of partial sums \((s_m)\) by
  $$
  \begin{align*}
  s_m = b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + ... + b_m,
  \end{align*}
  $$
and say that the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n\) converges to \(B\) if the sequence \((s_m)\) converges to \(B\). In this case, we write \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n = B\)
</div>
<p><br />
What is this even say? Suppose for a concrete example we’re given the series</p>
<div>
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8}.
    \end{align*}
    $$
</div>
<p>We want to know if this sum convergences to something. How to determine if the series convergence or not? The idea is to consider instead the <i>sequence of partial sums</i>. Each term in this sequence is defined as \(s_m = b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + ... + b_m\). So the first few terms will be:</p>
<div>
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    s_1 &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \\
	s_2 &amp;= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \\
	s_3 &amp;= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8} \\
	...
    \end{align*}
    $$
</div>
<p>And the sequence of partial sum \((s_m)\) is</p>
<div>
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{7}{8}, ..... 
    \end{align*}
    $$
</div>
<p>The idea is to see if this sequence (the sequence of partial sums \((s_m)\)) convergences. If we prove that this sequence converges to 1, then we can conclude by the definition above that the infinite sum \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n}\) also converges to 1. It’s important to stress here that through analyzing the sequence of partial sums, we’re going to be able to conclude whether the infinite series itself convergences.

</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Notes</b></h4>
<p>Cantor published this proof in 1874! It’s one of the most beautiful proofs I have ever seen.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>Assume for the sake of contradiction that (0,1) is countable. This means that there exists a function \(f: \mathbf{N} \rightarrow (0,1)\) that is 1-1 and onto. So for each \(m \in \mathbf{N}\), \(f(m)\) is a real number between 0 and 1. We’ll represent this number using the decimal notation. So for each \(m, n \in mathbf{N}, a_{mn}\) is the digit from the set {0,1,2,…,9} that represents that \(n\)th digit in the digital representation of \(f(m)\),</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
f(m) = .a_{m1}a_{m2}a_{m3}a_{m4}...a_{mn}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We can summarize the 1-1 correspondance between \(\mathbf{N}\) and \((0,1)\) in the following table,</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/real-analysis/cantor.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>This table by our assumption should have every number in the interval \((0,1)\). Now, we are going to construct construct a real number \(x = .x_1x_2x_3.... \in (0,1)\) by considering only the diagonal digits in the above table.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/real-analysis/cantor-1.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>

<p>The neat trick though is that we are going to select a different digit for \(x_n\) than what we have in \(a_{nn}\). So, for the digit \(x_1\), we are going to select something different than \(a_{11}\), \(x_2\) will be different than \(a_{22}\) and so on. In particular, we are going to use the following rule:</p>
<div>
  $$
  \begin{equation*}
  b_n = \begin{cases} 2 \quad \ \ \ \ \text{if } a_{nn} \neq 2 \\ 3 \quad \quad \text{if } a_{nn} = 2.\end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  $$
</div>
<p>The choice of the numbers 2 and 3 is made to avoid selecting a number that is equal to 0.999999999. So the selection of 2 and 3 is not really important here. We could make a different selection if we want as long as we don’t select 9. The important point to stress here is that we’re choosing a different digit than what’s on the diagonal. So if the diagonal digits were \(.a_{11}a_{22}a_{33}.... = 0.5242\), the number we select will be \(.x_{11}x_{22}x_{33}....=0.2323\)
<br />
<br />
The claim is that this number \(x\) is not in the table above! to see why, notice that \(x \neq f(1)\) because the digits \(x_1\) and \(a_{11}\) are not equal by construction. Similarly, \(x \neq f(2)\) because the digits \(x_2\) and \(a_{22}\) are different by construction. In fact, for any number in the table \(f(m)\) it can’t equal \(x\) because the digits \(x_{n}\) and \(a_{nn}\) will never be equal by our construction. Therefore, our assumption is incorrect and \((0,1)\) is uncountable.

<h4><b>Proof Discussion</b></h4>
<p>We’re going to show that \(\mathbf{Q}\) is countable by establishing that both \(\mathbf{N}\) and \(\mathbf{Q}\) have the same cardinality. To do so, we’re going to establish correspondance between the two sets meaning that we’re going to prove that there exists some mapping that is both one-to-one and onto between the two sets. For the second statement, this will be a proof by contradiction.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>Let \(A_1=\{0\}\) and for \(n \geq 2\), let A_n be</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
A_n = \{\pm \frac{p}{q}: \text{where $p, q \in \mathbf{N}$ are in lowest terms with $p + q = n$}\}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>For example \(A_2 = \{\frac{1}{1}, \frac{-1}{1}\}\) and \(A_3 = \{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{-1}{2}, \frac{2}{1}, -\frac{2}{1}\}\). Each set constructed using the above definition is finite. Moreover, Each element in \(\mathbf{Q}\) appears only in one set. We can establish a correspondance with \(\mathbf{N}\) by listing the elements in \(A_n\) against the elements in \(\mathbf{N}\) so,</p>

<p>to see how it’s onto. Consider any rational number \(\frac{p}{q}\) in its lowest form. We know that this number will appear in the set \(A_{p+q}\) by defintion. This number is

Proof Discussion We’re going to show that \(\mathbf{Q}\) is countable by establishing that both \(\mathbf{N}\) and \(\mathbf{Q}\) have the same cardinality. To do so, we’re going to establish correspondance between the two sets meaning that we’re going to prove that there exists some mapping that is both one-to-one and onto between the two sets. For the second statement, this will be a proof by contradiction. Proof Let \(A_1=\{0\}\) and for \(n \geq 2\), let A_n be $$ \begin{align*} A_n = \{\pm \frac{p}{q}: \text{where $p, q \in \mathbf{N}$ are in lowest terms with $p + q = n$}\}. \end{align*} $$ For example \(A_2 = \{\frac{1}{1}, \frac{-1}{1}\}\) and \(A_3 = \{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{-1}{2}, \frac{2}{1}, -\frac{2}{1}\}\). Each set constructed using the above definition is finite. Moreover, Each element in \(\mathbf{Q}\) appears only in one set. We can establish a correspondance with \(\mathbf{N}\) by listing the elements in \(A_n\) against the elements in \(\mathbf{N}\) so,]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Cardinality Definitions</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/07/analysis-card-definitions.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cardinality Definitions" /><published>2024-06-07T01:01:36-07:00</published><updated>2024-06-07T01:01:36-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/07/analysis-card-definitions</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/06/07/analysis-card-definitions.html"><![CDATA[<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h4><b>Definition: one-to-one and onto functions</b></h4>
<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">
  A function \(f: A \rightarrow B\) is one-to-one (1-1) if \(a_1 \neq a_2\) in \(A\) implies that \(f(a_1) \neq f(a_2)\) in \(B\). The function \(f\) is onto if, given any \(b \in B\), it is possible to find an element \(a \in A\) for which \(f(a) = b\).
</div>

<h4><b>Definition: Correspondance</b></h4>
<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">
  The set \(A\) has the same cardinality as \(B\) if there exists \(f: A \rightarrow B\) that is 1-1 and onto. In this case, we write \(A \thicksim B\).
</div>
<p><br />
This can also be written as \(\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = a\). What is this saying? After a certain number of terms, say after \(N\), all the points in the sequence will converge to a real number \(a\). Defining these points with \(|a_n - a| \leq \epsilon\) is explained in the next definition.

<h4><b>Definition: Countable Sets</b></h4>
<div style="background-color: #E3F4F4; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; border:1px solid black;">
  A set \(A\) is countable if \(N \thicksim A\). An infinite set that is not countable is called an uncountable set.

<h4><b>Problem Discussion</b></h4>
<p>We’ll follow a similar approach to proving the example in <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/04/analysis-seq-sqrt.html">here</a>. We want to show that \(\lim (x_n) = 0\). So we want to find \(n \geq N\) such that for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\),</p>

\begin{align*}
\lvert x_n - 0 \rvert &lt; \epsilon \\
\lvert x_n \rvert &lt; \epsilon.

<p>We’re given that \((|x_n|)\) converges to zero. So,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert |x_n - 0| \rvert &lt; \epsilon \\
\lvert |x_n| \rvert &lt; \epsilon \\
\lvert x_n \rvert &lt; \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>and this is exactly what we wanted to prove. we’re done!

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Formal Proof</b></h4>
<p>To show that \(\lim(x_n) = 0\), let \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) be arbitrary. We want to prove that there exists some \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that when \(n \geq N\), we’ll have</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert x_n - 0 \rvert &lt; \epsilon \\
\lvert x_n \rvert &lt; \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>To do so, we are given that \(\lim |x_n| = 0\). This means that there exists some \(n \geq N\) such that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert x_n - 0 \rvert &lt; \epsilon \\
\lvert |x_n| \rvert &lt; \epsilon \\
\lvert x_n \rvert &lt; \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>From this we can conclude that \((x_n)\) converges to 0 as we wanted to show. \(\blacksquare\)

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Alternative Proof (Squeeze Theorem)</b></h4>
<p>To show that \(\lim(x_n) = 0\), let \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) be arbitrary. We want to prove that there exists some \(n \geq N\) such that,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\lvert x_n - 0 \rvert &lt; \epsilon \\
\lvert x_n \rvert &lt; \epsilon
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Starting with \(x_n\). We know that \(x_n \leq |x_n|\) for any \(n \in \mathbf{N}\). Similarly \(x_n \geq -|x_n|\) (for the full proof see <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/26/analysis-absolute-value-properties.html">this</a>. So now we have</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
-|x_n| \leq x_n \leq |x_n|.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We’re given that \((|x_n|)\) converges to 0. Furthermore, by <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/01/analysis-seq-algebraic-limit-theorem-iii.html"> the algebraic limit theorem</a> we know that if \(\lim(a_n) = a\), then \(\lim(ca_n) = ca\) Therefore \(-|x_n|\) converges to 0 as well by setting \(c\) to -1. so now we have,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
0 \leq \lim(x_n) \leq 0.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>By the <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/05/analysis-seq-squeeze-theorem.html">sequenze theorem for sequences</a>, we can conclude that \((x_n)\) converges to 0 as we wanted to show. \(\blacksquare\)
