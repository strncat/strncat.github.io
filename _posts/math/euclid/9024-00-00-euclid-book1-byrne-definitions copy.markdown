<b>1</b>: A point is that which has no parts.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>2</b>: A line is length without breadth.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>3</b>: The extremities of a line are points.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>4</b>: A straight or right line is that which lies evenly between its extremities.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>5</b>: A surface is that which has length and breadth only.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>6</b>: The extremities of a surface are lines.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>7</b>: A plane surface is that which lies evenly between its extremities.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>8</b>: A plane angle is the inclination of two lines to one another, in a plane, which meet together, but are not in the same direction.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>9</b>: A plane rectilinear angle is the inclination of two straight lines to one another, which meet together, but are not in the same straight line.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>10</b>: When one straight line standing on another straight line makes the adjacent angles equal, each of these angles is called a right angle, and each of these lines is said to be perpendicular to the other.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>11</b>: An obtuse angle is an angle greater than a right angle.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>12</b>: An acute angle is less than a right angle.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>13</b>: A term or boundary is the extremity of any thing.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>14</b>: A figure is a surface enclosed on all sides by a line or lines.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>15</b>: A circle is a plane figure, bounded by one continued line, called its circumference or periphery; and having a certain point within it, from which all straight lines drawn to its circumference are equal.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>16</b>: This point (from which the equal lines are drawn) is called the centre of the circle.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>17</b>: A diameter of a circle is a straight line drawn through the centre, terminated both ways in the circumference.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>18</b>: A semicircle is the figure contained by the diameter, and the part of the circle cut off by the diameter.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>19</b>: A segment of a circle is a figure contained by a straight line, and the part of the circumference which it cuts off.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>20</b>: A figure contained by straight lines only, is called a rectilinear figure.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>21</b>: A triangle is a rectilinear figure included by three sides.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>22</b>: A quadrilateral figure is one which is bounded by four sides. The straight lines connecting the vertices of the opposite angles of a quadrilateral figure, are called its diagonal.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>23</b>: A polygon is a rectilinear figure bounded by more than four sides.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>24</b>: A triangle whose three sides are equal, is said to be equilateral.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>25</b>: A triangle which has only two sides equal is called an isosceles triangle.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>26</b>: A scalene triangle is one which has no two sides equal.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>27</b>: A right angled triangle is that which has a right angle.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>28</b>: An obtuse angled triangle is that which has an obtuse angle.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>29</b>: An acute angled triangle is that which has three acute angles.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>30</b>: Of four-sided figures, a square is that which has all its sides equal, and all its angles right angles.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>31</b>: A rhombus is that which has all its sides equal, but its angles are not right angles.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>32</b>: An oblong is that which has all its angles right angles, but has not all its sides equal.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>33</b>: A rhomboid is that which has its opposite sides equal to one another, but all its sides are not equal, nor its angles right angles.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>34</b>: All other quadrilateral figures are called trapeziums.
<br>
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>35</b>: Parallel straight lines are ſuch as are in the ſame plane, and which being produced continually in both directions, would never meet.
<br>
<hr>
