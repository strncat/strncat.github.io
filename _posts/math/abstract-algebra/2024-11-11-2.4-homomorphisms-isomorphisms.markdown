Consider the subgroup $$G_1 = \{\pm 1, \pm i\} \subset \mathbb{C}^*$$. Where $$\mathbb{C}^*$$ is the group of non-zero complex numbers equipped with multiplication. Another way to write this is $$G_1 = \{i^k \ | \ k = 0,1,2,3\}$$. The multiplication table for this subgroup is
<div>
<table style="max-width: 500px; margin: 20px auto;">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>\(1\)</td>
    <td>\(i\)</td>
	<td>\(-1\)</td>
	<td>\(-i\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\(1\)</td>
    <td>\(1\)</td>
    <td>\(i\)</td>
	<td>\(-1\)</td>
	<td>\(-i\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\(i\)</td>
    <td>\(i\)</td>
    <td>\(-1\)</td>
	<td>\(-i\)</td>
	<td>\(1\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\(-1\)</td>
    <td>\(-1\)</td>
    <td>\(-i\)</td>
	<td>\(1\)</td>
	<td>\(i\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\(-i\)</td>
    <td>\(-i\)</td>
    <td>\(1\)</td>
	<td>\(i\)</td>
	<td>\(-1\)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
And consider the cyclic subgroup $$G_2$$ of $$S_4$$, generated by $$\rho$$ where $$1$$ gets mapped to $$2$$, $$2$$ to $$3$$, $$3$$ to $$4$$ and $$4$$ to $$1$$. We can write this subgroup as 
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \rho = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
or 
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \langle \rho \rangle = \{\rho^n \ | \ n \in \mathbb{Z} \}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
Note here that $$\rho^2 \neq e$$ and similarly, $$\rho^3 \neq e$$. In fact $$\rho^4 = e$$. Writing this as a multiplication table:
<div>
<table style="max-width: 500px; margin: 20px auto;">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>\(e\)</td>
    <td>\(\rho\)</td>
	<td>\(\rho^2\)</td>
	<td>\(\rho^3\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\(e\)</td>
    <td>\(e\)</td>
    <td>\(\rho\)</td>
	<td>\(\rho^2\)</td>
	<td>\(\rho^3\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\(\rho\)</td>
    <td>\(\rho\)</td>
    <td>\(\rho^2\)</td>
	<td>\(\rho^3\)</td>
	<td>\(e\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\(\rho^2\)</td>
    <td>\(\rho^2\)</td>
    <td>\(\rho^3\)</td>
	<td>\(e\)</td>
	<td>\(\rho\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\(\rho^3\)</td>
    <td>\(\rho^3\)</td>
    <td>\(e\)</td>
	<td>\(\rho\)</td>
	<td>\(\rho^2\)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
We can see here that this multiplication table is just the first multiplication table relabeled. So $$G_1$$ and $$G_2$$ have the same multiplication table with a relabeling. Formally, (from 2.1)

<h3>The Preimage of a Function</h3>
Given some function $$f: X \rightarrow Y$$ and any subset $$B \subseteq Y$$, the preimage of $$B$$ in $$X$$ is $$\{x \in X \ : \ f(x) \in B\}$$. The conventional notation for the preimage of $$B$$ is $$f^{-1}(B)$$ even when the inverse of $$f$$ doesn't exist. Based on this, we have the following proposition
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2.4.12
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(\varphi : G \rightarrow H\) be a homomorphism of groups.
<ol type="a">
	<li>For each subgroup \(A \subseteq G\), \(\varphi(A)\) is a subgroup of \(H\).</li>
	<li>For each subgroup \(B \in H\)
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi^{-1}(B) &= \{ g \in G \ : \ \varphi(g) \in B\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
	is a subgroup of \(G\).
	</li>
</ol>
</div>
For $$(b)$$, $$\varphi^{-1}(B)$$ is the preimage of $$B$$. So we're saying that the preimage of $$B$$ is a subgroup given that $$B$$ is a subgroup itself and $$\varphi$$ is a homomorphism. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
For $$(a)$$, To show that $$\varphi(A)$$ is a subgroup of $$H$$, we need to show that $$\varphi(A)$$ is closed under multiplication and inverses. To see that it is closed under multiplication, we want to show for any $$y_1, y_2 \in \varphi(A)$$, $$y_1y_2  \in \varphi(A)$$. Since $$y_1$$ and $$y_2$$ are in $$\varphi(A)$$, then there must exist elements $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$ such that $$\varphi(x_1) = y_1$$ and $$\varphi(x_2) = y_2$$. 
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	y_1y_2 &= \varphi(x_1)\varphi(x_2) \\
	       &= \varphi(x_1x_2) \quad \text{(because $\varphi$ is a homomorphism)}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
We know that $$A$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$ so $$x_1x_2 \in A$$. Therefore, $$\varphi(x_1x_2)$$ must also be in $$\varphi(A)$$ and therefore $$y_1y_2 \in \varphi(A)$$.
<br>
<br>
To see that $$\varphi(A)$$ is closed inverses, let $$y \in \varphi(A)$$, we want to show that $$y^{-1} \in \varphi(A)$$. Since $$y \in \varphi(A)$$, then there must exist an element $$x \in A$$ such that $$y = \varphi(x)$$. But $$x$$'s inverse must be in $$A$$ since $$A$$ is a subgroup so $$x^{-1} \in A$$. Furthermore, since $$\varphi$$ is a homomorphism, then $$\varphi(x^{-1}) = (\varphi(x))^{-1} = y^{-1}$$ by Proposition 2.4.11. Therefore $$y^{-1} \in \varphi(A)$$
<br>
<br>
For (b), Let $$x_1, x_2 \in \varphi^{-1}(B)$$, we want to show that $$x_1x_2 \in \varphi^{-1}(B)$$. Since $$x_1, x_2 \in \varphi^{-1}(B)$$, then they are elements of $$G$$ such that $$\varphi(x_1)$$ and $$\varphi(x_2)$$ are in $$B$$. But $$B$$ is a subgroup and so it is closed under multiplication. Therefore, $$\varphi(x_1)\varphi(x_2) \in B$$ ...
