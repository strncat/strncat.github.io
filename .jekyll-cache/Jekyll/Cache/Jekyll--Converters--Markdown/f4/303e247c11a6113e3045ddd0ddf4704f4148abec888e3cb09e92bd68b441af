I"#<p>These notes are taken from watching the video in the reference. Suppose we want to graph the function of the form,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) = a^x
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>First, if \(a &lt; 0\), then weâ€™ll run into complex numbers and other issues so typically the exponential function is defined for any base that is greater than zero. So Suppose \(a &gt; 0\). We will still see that we have three cases:</p>
<ul>
	<li> When \(a &lt; 1\), we'll see something like this: (this is the function \(0.5^x\)). As \(x\) gets larger, \(y\) will approach \(0\). We can see this because \(f(1) = 1/2\), \(f(2) = 1/4, f(3) = 1/8\) and so on. 
	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/0.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p></li>
	<li> When \(a = 1\), we'll see just the line \(y = 1\). \(1^x\) is 1 no matter what \(x\) is! so not really interesting.</li>
	<li> When \(a &gt; 1\), for example when \(f(x) = 2^x\), then as the exponent gets bigger, we'll approach infinity. \(f(1) = 2, f(2) = 4, f(3) = 0\) and so on.
	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/1.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The trick to graphing these functions to always remember that we always have the points \((0,1)\) and \((1,a)\) plotted on our graph! so always evaluate the inputs \(0\) and \(1\).

<h3>The Domain and Range&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
It's important to know the domain and range to help see what the functions would look like. The domain here is any real number so $$(-\infty, \infty)$$. What about the range? We can never reach any number that is zero or below so the range can be written as $$(0, \infty)$$. This also means that $$y=0$$ is a horizontal asymptote. 
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Vertical Asymptotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
The domain is all the real numbers so we don't have any domain issues and so we won't have any vertical asymptotes.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Horizontal Asymptotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
so I know intuitively that for $$a^x$$ for example, the graph never reaches 0 no matter what $$x$$ values we plug in. This means that $$y=0$$ is a horizontal asymptote. I've also seen tutorials define the asymptote of exponential functions of the form $$f(x)=ca^{x+b}+d$$ to be $$d$$. Either way? it's kind of clear? or maybe now?
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>$$e^x$$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
$$e^x$$ comes up frequently but is there anything special about graphing it? not really. It is very similar to the above.

<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Vertical Shift&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
What happens if we're about to graph a function like $$3^x - 2$$. Notice here that we have a $$-2$$. This is a vertical shift that will shift be the whole graph of the function down two units (green curve moved down 2 units from the original blue curve). Note that the horizontal asymptote is also going to shift to -2.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/3.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Horizontal Shift&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
A horizontal shift example is the following:
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) = 2^{x+2}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
We know originally we had $$2^x$$ along with a horizontal asymptote at $$y=0$$ and the points $$(0,1)$$ and $$(1,2)$$. What's going to happen now? The whole graph is going to shift 2 points to the left (opposite of the sign in the exponent). This means that the x coordinates of the all the points we plotted for the original graph will now decrease by two. So $$(0,1)$$ will be $$()-2,1)$$. Similarly, $$(1,2)$$ will now be $$(-1,2)$$. One more thing that we usually plot is the y-intercept. To find it, we just evaluate $$f(0) = 2^{0+2} = 4$$. The horizontal asymptote is unaffected here.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/4.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Reflection Around the Horizontal Asymptote&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
Suppose we're graphing the following function:
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) = -3^x + 1.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
We can see here that we have a negative sign in front of the exponential. $$(- (3^x))$$. This negative sign will reflect the whole curve around its horizontal asymptote which is $$y=1$$ in this example. To graph this function, let's start by graphing the original function $$3^x$$ with the known two points $$(0,1)$$ and $$(1,3)$$ as well as the horizontal asymptote at $$y=0$$.
<br />
<br />
Next,
<ul>
	<li> We have a vertical shift (+1) and so the horizontal asymptote will move up by one point be $$y=1$$. So the new points will be $$(0,2)$$ and $$(1,4)$$. The black curve ($$3^x$$) shifts up to become the purple curve ($$3^x+1$$). 
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/5a.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
</li>	
		
<li> The negative sign infront reflects the curve around the horizontal asymptote $$y=1$$. For this step it might also be easier to also evaluate the known points keeping in mind that we expect to see a reflection so $$f(0) = -(3^0)+1=0$$ and $$f(1) = -(3^1)+1=-2$$.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/5b.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p></li>
</ul>
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>More Examples&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
Suppose we're graphing the following function:
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) = 5 - 2e^{-x+1}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
We have a lot going on here. Let's re-arrange so that:
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) = - 2e^{-(x-1)} + 5.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
Before diving in, let's graph the $$e^x$$ so we can have something to compare against.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/6-a.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
So this is \(e^x\) along with the points \((0,1)\) and \((1,e)\). Now, let's dive into the transformations:
<ul>

<li>If we look at the exponent and inside the parenthesis, we see that we have a -1. This means that it's a shift to the right by 1. This also means that our points' x-coordinates will shift by 1 and so \((0,1)\) and \((1,e)\) will now be \((1,1)\) and \((2,e)\). </li>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/6-b.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
The green curve above is the graph of \(e^{(x-1)}\).

<li>But what about the negative sign outside the parenthesis in the exponent? This negative sign will reflect the graph around the y-axis. But it's tricker here because we moved the points 1 point to the right! so what we want to reflect this graph around $$x=1$$ instead.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/6-c.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
The red curve above is the graph of \(e^{-(x-1)}\).

<li>Next we have the "2" factor at the beginning will just stretch the graph vertically by 2. There is also a negative sign. This negative sign will cause the curve to get reflected around the horizontal asymptote this time. </li>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/6-d.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
The black curve above is the graph of \(-2e^{-(x-1)}\). Now we'll have the points \((1,-2)\) and \((0,-2e)\).

<li>Finally, the vertical shift is 5 so the horizontal asymptote moves to $$y=5$$ and the y-coordinate of all the points will be increased by 5.</li>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/graphs/exponential/6-e.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>
The green curve above is the graph of \(-2e^{-(x-1)} + 5\). Now we'll have the points \((1,3)\) and \((0,-2e+5)\).</li>
</ul>
