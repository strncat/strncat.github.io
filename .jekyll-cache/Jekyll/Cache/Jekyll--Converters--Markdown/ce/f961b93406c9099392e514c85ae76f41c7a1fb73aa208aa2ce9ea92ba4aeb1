1.6 Exercise 11
</div>
<div class="ybdiv">
Let \(u\) and \(v\) be distinct vectors of a vector space \(V\). Show that if \(\{u, v\}\) is basis for \(V\), and \(a\) and \(b\) are non-zero scalars, then both \(\{u+v, au\}\) and \(\{au, bv\}\) are also bases for \(V\).
</div>
<p><br />
Proof: 
<br />
To prove that \(\{u+v, au\}\) is basis, we need to show that the set of vectors are linearly independent and that \(span(\{u+v, au\}) = V\). Let \(a_1, a_2\) be any two scalars. Then we want to prove that the following equation</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	a_1(u+v) + a_2(au) = \bar{0}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>is only satisfied by the trivial solution. Weâ€™ll re-arrange the terms as follows,</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\bar{0} &amp;= a_1u + a_1v + aa_2u  \\
	&amp;= (a_1 + aa_2)u + a_1v \\
	&amp;= (a_1 + aa_2)u + a_1v.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>From this, we can see that the only solution is the trivial solution since \(\{u,v\}\) are linearly independent. Moreover, since \(\{u,v\}\) is a basis, then its dimension is 2. Therefore, \(\{u+v, au\}\) is a basis.
<br />
<br />
Similarly, to see that \(\{au, bv\}\), weâ€™ll prove the following equationâ€™s solution is the trivial solution only by re-arranging the terms,</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\bar{0} &amp;= a_1(au) + a_2(bv) \\
	\bar{0} &amp;= (a_1a)u + (a_2b)v.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is again a linear combination of two linearly independent vectors and so the trivial solution is the only possible solution to this equation. Since the set has 2 vectors, then itâ€™s a basis as well. \(\blacksquare\)
