From the book, a symmetry is an undetectable motion. An object is symmetric if it has symmetries. Take he rectangular card below for example

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/geometry/convex-hull/conv-0.png" width="100%" class="center"></p>

Consider the axis perpendicular to the faces of the rectangle and passing through the centroid of the faces. We can see that we have two rotations that leave the object unchanged. A rotation by $$\pi$$ and a rotation by 0 radians that does nothing. We will not consider the rotations $$\pm 2\pi, \pm 3\pi,...$$ because rotating by $$2\pi$$ is the same as the non-motion or 0 radians rotation. We will only account fot the distinct final positions of the card. 

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/geometry/convex-hull/conv-0.png" width="100%" class="center"></p>

The other two rotations that we can perform are a flip ($$\pi$$ rotation) around the $$x$$-axis and another flip around the $$y$$ axis. 

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/geometry/convex-hull/conv-0.png" width="100%" class="center"></p>

Another observation that we can make here is that if we leave the room and perform two rotations on the rectangular card and then come back, we will not distinguish the result because the composition of the two symmetries is yet another symmetry.

We often represent these transformations and their compositions in a multiplication table of the symmetries.
