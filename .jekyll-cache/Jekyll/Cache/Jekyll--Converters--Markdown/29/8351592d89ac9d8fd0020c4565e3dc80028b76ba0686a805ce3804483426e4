<p>Label the strings $s_1, s_2,â€¦,s_k$ and label the buckets $b_1, b_2,â€¦,b_n$. $s_1$ has $n$ choices of buckets to choose from. $s_2$ has $n$ choices of buckets to choose from and so. Therefore, the total number of choices is</p>
<div center="">
$$
\begin{align*}
n^k
\end{align*}
$$
</div>

<h3>(2) k distinguishable strings and n distinguishable buckets with at most 1 string in each bucket</h3>
<p>Assuming $k \leq n$ (otherwise it is impossible). Label the strings $s_1, s_2,â€¦,s_k$ and label the buckets $b_1, b_2,â€¦,b_n$. $s_1$ has $n$ choices of buckets to choose from. $s_2$ has $n-1$ choices of buckets to choose from because it canâ€™t go to the bucket that $s_1$ chose. Similarly, $s_3$ has $n-2$ and so on. Therefore, the total number of choices is</p>
<div center="">
$$
\begin{align*}
n(n-1) ... (n-k+1) = \binom{n}{k} * k!
\end{align*}

<h3>(3) k indistinguishable strings and n distinguishable buckets</h3>
<p>Label the buckets $b_1, b_2,â€¦,b_n$ and line them up below:

The strings are indistinguishable. We want to distribute them among the buckets so for example we could have the following:
<img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/counting/0b.png" alt="my photo" />
To simplify the problem, letâ€™s pretend that they are distinguishable and instead of buckets weâ€™ll use dividers to separate the strings into different buckets. This way the first set of strings are in bucket 1, the second set after the first divider are in bucket 2 and so on. Weâ€™ll use colors to distinguish them. We will only need $n-1$ dividers to create $n$ groups.
<br />
<br />
To visualize this, suppose $n=4$ and $k=5$. In the below figure, we have ${s_1,s_2}$ in the first bucket. ${s_3}$ in the second bucket. ${s_4,s_5}$ in the third bucket. The forth bucket is empty.

How many possible permutions are there? We have $n-1$ dividers and $k$ strings so</p>
<div center="">
$$
\begin{align*}
(n+k-1)!
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Now, since strings are really indistinguishable, letâ€™s remove the labels. We also donâ€™t need the colors because weâ€™re assuming the first set of strings goes to the first bucket, the second set goes to the second bucket and so on. So weâ€™ll have something like this:
<img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/counting/2.png" alt="my photo" />
To remove the unnecessary ordering, we divide by $k!$ and also divide by $(n-1)!$. Therefore, the final answer is</p>
<div center="">
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{(n+k-1)!}{k!(n-1)!} = \binom{n+k-1}{n-1}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Note that solution can be applied to other interesting examples like finding the number of integer solutions to $x_1+x_2+â€¦+x_k=n$.

<h3>(4) k indistinguishable strings and n distinguishable buckets with at most 1 string in each bucket</h3>
<p>In case (2), we saw that the number of ways to put $k$ distinguishable strings into $n$ distinguishable buckets with at most 1 string in each bucket is $\binom{n}{k} * k!$. In this case, the strings are indistinguishable so we donâ€™t care about the order of strings and so we divide by $k!$. The final answer therefore is simply</p>
<div center="">
$$
\begin{align*}
\binom{n}{k}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
