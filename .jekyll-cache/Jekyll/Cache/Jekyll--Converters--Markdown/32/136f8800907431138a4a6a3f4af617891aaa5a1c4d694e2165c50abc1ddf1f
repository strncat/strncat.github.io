<p>So far we discussed some theory behind triangultion. We proved the existence of a diagonal and triagulation for simple polygons. We also wrote code to verify for a given polygon $p$ and a given line segment $d$, whether $d$ is an internal diagonal or not. So where do we go from here to actually triangulate $p$?

<h4><b>The Naive Solution: Test All Candidates</b></h4>
<p>How many potentional cadidates for a diagonal do we have in a given polygon $p$ with $n$ vertices? Since the diagonal must intersect $p$ at its end points, then we know that the diagonal’s start and end points must be from the $n$ vertices. This means that we have ${n \choose 2} = O(n^2)$ possible segments to test. The test we developed in the previous post (Triangulation (Finding a Diagonal) costs $O(n)$ time since we iterate over all vertices to test for intersection Moreover, we know that since $p$ has $n$ vertices then the triagulation of $p$ will use $n-3$ diagonals. Therefore, we will end up with an $O(n^4)$ total cost if we naively</p>
