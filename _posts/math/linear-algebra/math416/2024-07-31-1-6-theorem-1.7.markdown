This is the proof for theorem 1.7 from the book which I don't think we covered in lecture.
<div class="purdiv">
Theorem 1.7
</div>
<div class="purbdiv">
If \(S\) is a linearly independent subset of \(V\) and \(v\) is a vector in \(V\) but not \(S\). Then \(S \cup \{v\}\) is linearly dependent if and if only if \(v \in span(S)\).
</div>
Proof: 
<br>
<br>
$$\Rightarrow$$: Since $$S \cup \{v\}$$ is linearly dependent, then there are vectors $$u_1,u_2,...,u_n$$ in $$S \cup \{v\}$$ and not all zero scalars $$a_1,...,a_n$$ such that
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	a_1u_1 + a_2u_2 + ... + a_nu_n = \bar{0}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
But we know that $$S$$ is linearly independent so this means one of the vectors in $$\{u_1,u_2,...,u_n\}$$ must be $$v$$. without the loss of generality let $$u_1 = v$$ and so 
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\bar{0} &= a_1v + a_2u_2 + ... + a_nu_n \\
	v &= \frac{1}{a_1}(-a_2u_2 - ... - a_nu_n) \\
	v &= -\frac{a_2}{a_1}u_2 - ... - \frac{a_n}{a_1}u_n. \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
This tells us that $$v$$ is a linear combination of the elements of $$u_2,...,u_n$$ in $$S$$. Therefore, by definition, $$v \in span(S)$$.
<br>
<br>
$$\Leftarrow$$: Let $$v \in span(S)$$, then there exists vectors $$w_1,w_2,...,w_m$$ in $$S$$ and scalars $$b_1,...,b_n$$ such that
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	v = b_1w_1 + b_2w_2 + ... + b_nw_m.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
Moving $$v$$ to the other side, we see that,
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 b_1w_1 + b_2w_2 + ... + b_nw_m + (-1).v = \bar{0}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
We know here that $$v$$ is not in $$S$$ and so none of the vectors $$w_1,...,w_m$$ are equal to $$v$$. Moreover, the coefficient of $$v$$ is none zero. Therefore, by the definition of linear dependence, $$S \cup \{v\}$$ is linearly dependent. $$\blacksquare$$.
