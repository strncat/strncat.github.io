<h4><b>Convexity</b></h4>
<p>A set of points $S$ is convex if for any two points $a \in S$ and $b \in S$, then the line segment connecting these two points is also in $S$ ($\overline{ab} subseteq \in S$). A convex polygon is a polygon that is the boundary of a convex set. The left figure is a convex polygon while the right figure is not per our definition.

<h4><b>Convex Hull</b></h4>
<p>The convex hull of a set $S$ is the smallest convex set that contains all the points in $S$. We also define the convex hull of $S={p_1,p_2,…,p_n}$ as the set that contains all the combinations of the points in the $S$. Formally,
\(\begin{align*}
CH(S) = \{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i p_i | \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i = 1 \text{ and } \lambda_i \geq 0 \text{ for all $i$} \}
\end{align*}\)
<br />
<br />
Another definition that is also used is that the convex hull of $S$ is,
[s
CH(S) = \text{ Intersection of all convex sets containing $P$ }
]
Why does this definition matter? there are infinitely many convex sets that will contain all the points in $S$. It turns out that this definition also works for a special kind of convex sets, called half-planes!
[
CH(S) = \text{ Intersection of all “half planes” containing $P$ }
]
Finding the convex hull is a class computatioal geometry problem and many algorithms have been developed to solve it. Next, we discuss of the simplest algorithms that is used to find the convex hull of a set of
