<p>Let \([c,d] = \{c \leq x \leq d\}\) be a closed interval.

  Prove that a set \(F \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) is closed if and only if it contains its limit points.
</div>
<p><br />
This was listed in the book as a definition but I was wondering why it’s true. luckily I found this nice proof <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh1noyFVNVg">online</a> and it goes like this:
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>\(\Rightarrow\): Let \(F\) be a set and assume that \(F\) is closed, then we’ll prove that \(F\) contains its limit points. To do so, assume for the sake of contradiction that it doesn’t. Therefore, let \(x\) be a limit point such that \(x \notin F\). By the definition of a <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/24/analysis-sets-limit-points.html">limit point</a>, we know there must exist a sequence \((a_n)\) that is contained in \(F\) such that \((a_n) \rightarrow x\) and \(x\) is not a term of the sequence. Since \(x\) is not in \(F\), then \(x\) must be in \(F^c\) and since \(F\) is closed, \(F^c\) must be open (todo proof link). But by the definition of an <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/22/analysis-sets-open.html">open set</a> there must exist an interval around \(x\) that is all included in \(F^c\) or in other words, for some \(\delta &gt; 0\), we must have some interval \((x-\delta, x+\delta) \subseteq F^c\). But this means that the sequence \((a_n)\) can’t possibly converge to \(x\) since the neighborhood \((x-\delta, x+\delta)\) is not in \(F\). Rigorously, since \((a_n) \rightarrow x\), then for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), we must have an \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that if \(n \geq N\), \(|a_n - x| &lt; \epsilon\). This means that after the \(N\)th term, \(n\) can get really close to \(x\). But if set \(\epsilon = \delta\), this means that \(a_n \in (x - \delta, x + \delta)\). This means that these terms are part of \(F^c\) and not \(F\). This is a contradiction and so \(x\) must belong to \(F\) as we wanted to show.
<br />
<br />
\(\Leftarrow\): We will prove the contrapositive of the statement instead so assume that \(F\) is not closed, we will prove that \(F\) doesn’t contain all of its limit points. Since \(F\) is not closed, then \(F^c\) is not open (TODO: add proof link). By the definition of an <a href="https://strncat.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/22/analysis-sets-open.html">open set</a>, we know that for any point \(f\) in the set, there exist an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood such that \(V_{\epsilon}(f)\) is included in the set. But because \(F^c\) is not open, then there exists an element \(x \in F^c\) such that for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\) is not a subset of \(F^c\). This means that there will always be some element in \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\) that is not contained in \(F^c\) and so it is in \(F\). Now, for each \(n \in \mathbf{N}\), take \(a_n \in V_{1/n}(x) \cap F\). So \(a_1 \in V_1(x)\), \(a_2 \in V_{1/2},...\). This sequence will converge to \(x\) because as we move further, \(a_n\) gets closer and closer to \(x\). To prove that \((a_n) \rightarrow x\), suppose \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) and choose \(N &gt; 1/\epsilon\) so that for any \(n &gt; N\),</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|a_n - x| &amp;&lt; \frac{1}{n} \\
&amp;&lt; \frac{1}{N} \\
&amp;&lt; \frac{1}{1/\epsilon} = \epsilon,
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>which shows that \((a_n) \rightarrow x\). So we just showed a sequence in \(F\) where its limit point \(x\) is not in \(F\) as required. \(\blacksquare\).

  (3.2.5) A point \(x\) is a limit point of a set \(A\) if and only if \(x = \lim a_n\) for some sequence \(a_n\) contained in \(A\) satisfying \(a_n \neq x\) for all \(n \in \mathbf{N}\).
</div>
<p><br />
So “\(x\) is a limit point of \(A\)” means that \(x\) is the limit of a sequence in \(A\). The only thing we don’t want is to have any term of that sequence be \(x\) itself. The reason for this is then every member of the set could potentially be a limit point since we can create the sequence \(\{x,x,x,x,x,...\}\) and we don’t want that.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>\(\Rightarrow\): Assume that \(x\) is a limit point of \(A\) and so for every \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), the intersection of \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\) with the set \(A\) is nonempty and has an element that is not \(x\). We then want to prove that there is a sequence of points \(a_1, a_2, a_3, ...\) from \(A/\{x\}\) such that \((a_n) \rightarrow x\). Now for each \(n \in \mathbf{N}\), pick a point</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a_n \in V_{1/n}(x) \cap A,
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This means that the first element in the sequence is in \(V_1(x)\), the second element is in \(V_{1/2}(x)\). The third element is in \(V_{1/3}(x)\) and so on (We are basically getting closer and closer to \(x\)). This sequence \((a_n)\) coverages to \(x\). To see why, let \(\epsilon &gt; 0\). We can choose \(N\) such that \(N &gt; \frac{1}{\epsilon}\). So now for any \(n &gt; N\),</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|a_n - x| &amp;&lt; \frac{1}{n} \quad \text{ All the elements in $V_{1/n}$ must be within $1/n$ at most from $x$}\\
&amp;&lt; \frac{1}{N} \\
&amp;&lt; \frac{1}{1/\epsilon} = \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>

<p><br />
<br />
\(\Leftarrow\): Assume that \((a_n) \rightarrow x\) where \(a_n \in A\) and \(a_n \neq x\). Let \(V_{\epsilon}\) be arbitrary. We want to prove that there some element from \((a_n)\) in that neighborhood \(V_{\epsilon}\). But since \((a_n) \rightarrow x\), then we know that there exists an \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that if \(n \geq N\), we must have \(|a_n - x| \leq \epsilon\). Therefore, for any \(n \geq N\), we know that we have \(a_n \in V_{\epsilon}\).</p>

</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>Let \(\{O_{}: \lambda \in \Lambda\}\) be a collection of open sets and let \(O = \bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda}O_{\lambda}\). Let \(a\) be an arbitrary element of \(O\). To show that \(O\) is open, we need to produce an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood of \(a\) that is contained in \(O\). Since \(a \in O\), then \(a\) must be in at least one particular set \(O_{\lambda'}\). But we know that \(O_{\lambda'}\) is open and so there must exists a neighborhood \(V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq O_{\lambda'}\). But since \(O_{\lambda'} \subseteq O\), then \(V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq O\) as we wanted to show.
<br />
<br />
For (ii), let \(\{O_1, O_2, ..., O_N\}\) be a finite collection of open sets. We know that \(a \in \bigcap_{k=1}^{N} O_k\). This means that there exists  \(V_{\epsilon_k}(a) \subseteq O_{k}\). But since this is an intersection, the trick is to take the smallest one and therefore let \(\epsilon = min\{\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, ..., \epsilon_N\}\). Since \(V_{\epsilon}(a)\) is the smallest one now, then we know \(V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq V_{\epsilon_k}(a)\) for all \(k\) and so \(V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq \bigcap_{k=1}^{N} O_k\) as we wanted to show. \(\blacksquare\).

<p>Let \((a_n)\) be a sequence and let two subsequences converge to different limits or have a subsequence diverge. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \((a_n)\) converges to a limit \(a\).

For the absolute value function definition and other properties see here. For the definitions of sequences, subsequences and what it means to for a sequence to converge, see this. For the “show the limit” template and an example, see this. Proof: Let \((a_n)\) be a sequence and let two subsequences converge to different limits or have a subsequence diverge. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \((a_n)\) converges to a limit \(a\). This means that every subsequence of \((a_{n_k})\) must converge \(a\) by the proof we did earlier here. But this is a contradiction since we assumed that two subsequences converge to different limits or that a subsequence diverges. Therefore, \((a_n)\) must diverge as required. \(\blacksquare\) References: Wrath of Math Youtube Channel]]></summary></entry></feed>
