We'll start by defining Quotient Rings
<br>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition: Quotient Ring
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(R\) be a ring and \(I\) be an ideal in \(R\). Then let the quotient ring \(R/I\)
$$
\begin{align*}
R/I = \{a + I \ | \ a + R\}
\end{align*}
$$
be the set of all \(I\)-cosets in \(R\) with operations:
<ol>
	<li>Addition: \((a + I) + (b + I) = (a + b) + I\).</li>
	<li>Multiplication: \((a + I) + (b + I) = (ab) + I\).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
Note that there are other notations used for $$I + a$$. One notation is $$[a]$$ or $$\bar{a}$$.
<br>
<br>
The claim is that these operations are well defined and will make the quotient set with the operations defined a ring. For addition, it's already part of how we defined quotient groups? For multiplication, we need to show that if $$a + I = a' + I$$ and $$b + I = b' + I$$. Then
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
ab + I = a'b' + 1
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
To see this, write $$a' = a + u$$ and $$b' = b + v$$ for some $$u, v \in I$$. Then
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a'b' &= (a + u)(b + v) \\
     &= ab + av + ub + uv
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
$$av + ub + uv$$ is in $$I$$ since $$I$$ is an ideal. Therefore, $$a'b' + (av+ub+uv)$$ and $$ab + I$$ represent the same ideal. 
<br>
<br>
Next, we need to show that $$R/I$$ is an abelian group with addition. And then we need to show that multiplication is associative and distributes over addition. (exercise)

<h3>Quotient Homomorphism</h3>

<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition: Quotient Homomorphism
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(R\) be a ring and \(I\) be an ideal in \(R\). Define
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi: R &\rightarrow R/I \\
     \pi(a) &= a + I
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
So just send any element to its coset. We already know this makes a group homomorphism for quotient groups. It also makes a ring homomorphism. We just need to check. It is also surjective because every coset comes from some element in $$I$$. The kernel of the homomorphism $$\ker(\pi) = I$$.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Example 1</h3>
Take $$R = \mathbf{Z}$$ and take $$I$$ to be a principle ideal generated by some element $$d$$ so $$I = (d) = \mathbf{Z}d$$. Then
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
R/I = \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}d = \mathbf{Z}_d
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Example 2</h3>
Take the ring of polynomials $$R[x]$$. If we quotient this ring by the principle ideal generated by $$(x^2 + 1)$$, then we get the ring of complex numbers. $$R[x]/(x^2+1) \cong \mathbf{C}$$
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Quotient Rings of Polynomial Rings</h3>
Let $$K$$ be a field. Let $$R = K[x]$$ be the ring of polynomials over the field $$K$$ and let $$I \subseteq R$$. From this, form the quotient ring $$S = K[x]/I$$.  Notice here that since the ideal is in a polynomial ring over a field, then we know every ideal is principle. So $$I$$ is a principle ideal generated by some polynomial and we can write $$I = (f)$$ for some $$f \in R$$. 
<br>
<br>
For example, $$R/(0) \cong R$$. If $$I$$ is not $$\{0\}$$, then choose $$f$$ to be monic of minimal degree. Now write
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
f = x^n + a_{n-1}x + ... + a_0, a_0,...,a_{n-1} \in K
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
Then $$S = K[x] /(f)$$. We have the following claim based on this.
<br>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Every element in \(S\) has the form \(r + I\) for some unique \(r \in K[x]\) such that \(\deg(r) < n\). 
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
Use division with remainder. If $$g + I \in S$$ where $$g \in K[x]$$, then there exists unique $$q, r \in K[x]$$ such that $$g = qf + r$$ where $$\deg(r) < n = \deg(f)$$. This means we can write $$g - r = qf$$. We know that $$qf \in I$$ since it's a multiple of $$f$$. Since $$g - r = qf$$, then $$g-r$$ is also in $$I$$. This implies that $$g$$ and $$r$$ are in the same $$I$$-coset. Therefore $$g+I = r+I$$. $$\blacksquare$$.
<br>
<br>
$$r + I$$ is the canonical form of an element in $$S = K[x] / (f)$$. 
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Example</h3>
Suppose $$K = \mathbf{Q}$$ be the rationals ring, $$S = \mathbf{Q}[x]/(f)$$ be the quotient ring and let $$f = x^2 - 2$$ so $$I = (f)$$ is the ideal generated by this polynomial $$f=x^2-2$$. 
<br>
<br>
Using the previous result, we know that Every element of $$S$$ can be written as $$r + I$$ for a unique $$r \in Q[x]$$ such that $$\deg(r) < \deg(f)=2$$. Therefore, we can write $$r + I$$ as
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
(a + bx) + I = a + b\bar{x} \quad a,b \in \mathbf{Q}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
This notation is a shorthand for: given $$a \in \mathbf{Q}$$, then write $$a$$ or $$\bar{a}$$ instead of writing $$a + I \in S$$  where $$a+I$$ is the coset of constant polynomials in $$S$$. Also write $$\bar{x}$$ for the element $$x + I$$. So, then
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
(a + b\bar{x}) + (a' + b'\bar{x}) &= (a+a') + (b+b')\bar{x} \\
(a + b\bar{x}) (a' + b'\bar{x}) &= aa' + ab'\bar{x} + ba'\bar{x} + bb'\bar{x}^2
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
but now we have $$\bar{x}^2$$. That's because we still need to divide by $$f$$. If we divide $$\bar{x}^2$$ by $$x^2 - 2$$, the remainder is 2. So $$\bar{x}^2$$ is really 2 in the ring $$R/(f)$$. Then we can simplify this to 
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
(a + b\bar{x}) (a' + b'\bar{x}) &= aa' + ab'\bar{x} + ba'\bar{x} + 2bb' \\
                                &= (aa' + 2bb') +(ab'+ba')\bar{x}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
Remark: This quotient ring $$S$$ is isomorphic to $$\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{2})$$ which is a subring of $$\mathbf{R}$$. $$\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{2})$$ is the ring
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\{a+b\sqrt{2} \ | \ a,b \in \mathbf{Q}\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
The isomorphism between these rings is 
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a+b\bar{x} \rightarrow a + b\sqrt{2}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>

<h3>Homomorphism Theorem</h3>
We start by a recipe to form a new homomorphism from a quotient ring.
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Homomorphism Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(\varphi: R \rightarrow S\) be a ring homomorphism and \(I \subseteq R\) be an ideal. If \(I \subseteq \ker(\varphi)\) (ie. \(\varphi(I) = \{0\}\)), then there exists a ring homomorphism \(\bar{\varphi}: R/I \rightarrow S\). Such that \(\bar{\varphi}(a + I) = \varphi(a)\)
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
To prove this we need to show that the new homomorphism $$\bar{\phi}$$ is well defined and then we need to show that it's a ring homomorphism. And then we have the isomorphism theorem as follows
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Isomorphism Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(\varphi: R \rightarrow S\) be a <b>surjective</b> ring homomorphism and \(I \subseteq R\) be an ideal. If \(I = \ker(\varphi)\), then we have an isomorphism of rings 
$$
\begin{align*}
\bar{\varphi}: R/I &\rightarrow S \\ 
\bar{\varphi}(a + I) &= \varphi(a)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Example 1</h3>
Let $$R = \mathbf{Q}[x]$$ and $$S = \mathbf{R}$$. Since we want to build a homomorphism from a polynomial ring, then we should always think of the substitution principle. Recall that the substitution principle says that given that we have a homomorphism (in this case let this homomorphism be the identity function), then we can create the following evaluation homomorphism
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi: \mathbf{Q}[x] &\rightarrow \mathbf{R} \\ 
\varphi(a) &= a \quad \text{if } a \in \mathbf{Q} \subseteq \mathbf{Q}[x] \\
\varphi(x) &= \sqrt{2} \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
So in this case, it's just an evaluation. So, given some polynomial $$f$$, then 
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi: \mathbf{Q}[x] &\rightarrow \mathbf{R} \\ 
\phi(f) &= f(\sqrt{2})
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
What is the kernel of this homomorphism?
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
I = \ker(\varphi) &= \{ f \in \mathbf{Q}[x] \ | \ \varphi(f) = 0 \} \\
 &= \{ f \in \mathbf{Q}[x] \ | \ f(\sqrt{2}) = 0 \}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
So it's any polynomial that has $$\sqrt{2}$$ as a root. Since $$\mathbf{Q}$$ is a field, then we know that the kernel is principle. So it's generated by a single monic polynomial of minimal degree. First of all, this kernel isn't trivial. For example $$x^2 - 2$$ has a $$\sqrt{2}$$ as a root of degree 2. If we know that we don't have constant polynomials or polynomials of degree 1, then we know $$x^2 - 2$$ is a generator for the group. Constant non-zero polynomials don't have roots. Linear polynomials can't have $$\sqrt{2}$$ as a root. The roots will be rationals since the coefficients are rational.
<br>
<br>
So now we have a homomorphism $$\varphi$$ from $$\mathbf{Q}[x]$$ to $$\mathbf{R}$$. Moreover, we also have the canonical quotient homomorphism from $$\mathbf{Q}[x]$$ to $$\mathbf{Q}[x]/(x^2-2)$$.
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi: \mathbf{Q}[x] &\rightarrow \mathbf{Q}[x]/(x^2-2) \\ 
\phi(f) &= f + (x^2 - 2)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
The homomorphism takes a polynomial $$f$$ in $$\mathbf{Q}[x]$$ to its coset.
<br>
<br>
So notice now that we have a homomorphism $$\varphi: \mathbf{Q}[x] \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$$ and we have the canonical homomorphism $$\pi: \mathbf{Q}[x] \rightarrow \mathbf{Q}[x]/(x^2-2)$$. Before we can apply the isomorphism theorem, we have one issue which is that $$\varphi$$ is not surjective. We can fix this by restricting the target to only the image of $$\varphi$$ so
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi': \mathbf{Q}[x] &\rightarrow \varphi(\mathbf{Q}[x]) \\ 
f(x) &\rightarrow f(\sqrt{2}) \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
So now we have a surjective homomorphism where the kernel is $$I = (x^2 - 2)$$ and we formed the quotient ring $$\mathbf{Q}[x]/(x^2-2)$$. Therefore, we can now apply the isomorphism to conclude that $$\mathbf{Q}[x]/(x^2-2)$$ is isomorphic to $$\varphi(\mathbf{Q}[x])$$. Moreover, we have an isomorphism defined by
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\bar{\varphi}: \mathbf{Q}[x]/(x^2-2) &\rightarrow \varphi(\mathbf{Q}[x]) \\ 
f + (x^2 - 2) &\rightarrow \varphi(f) = f(\sqrt{2})
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
Note that $$\varphi(\mathbf{Q}[x])$$ are all the real numbers we can get by plugging in $$\sqrt{2}$$ into polynomials with rational coefficients. So
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= a_0 + a_1x + ... + a_nx^n, \quad a_i \in \mathbf{Q} \\
f(\sqrt{2}) &= a_0 + a_1(\sqrt{2}) + ... + a_n(\sqrt{2})^n, \quad a_i \in \mathbf{Q}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
But $$(\sqrt{2}) = 2, (\sqrt{2})^3 = 2\sqrt{2}$$ and in general $$(\sqrt{2})^2k = 2^k$$ while $$(\sqrt{2})^{2k+1} = 2^k\sqrt{2}$$. So any $$f(\sqrt{2})$$ simplifies to $$a + b\sqrt{2}$$. Therefore
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi(\mathbf{Q}) = \{ a + b\sqrt{2} \ | \ a,b \in \mathbf{Q} \}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Example 2</h3>
Suppose we have a homomorphism which is just the identity function $$id$$ from $$\mathbf{R} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$$. Based on this create the evaluation homomorphism
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi: \mathbf{R}[x] &\rightarrow \mathbf{C} \\ 
\varphi(a) &\rightarrow a \\
\varphi(x) &\rightarrow i
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
This homomorphism is in fact surjective. The kernel of this homomorphism is generated by $$(x^2+1)$$. Therefore,
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{R}[x]/(x^2+1) \cong \mathbf{C}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Example 3</h3>
This take, let's take the rational numbers instead so
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi: \mathbf{Q}[x] &\rightarrow \mathbf{R} \\ 
\varphi(a) &\rightarrow a \\
\varphi(x) &\rightarrow \sqrt[3]{2}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
The kernel of this homomorphism is generated by $$(x^3-2)$$. The image of this homomorphism is a subset of $$\mathbf{R}$$. 
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{Q}[x]/(x^3-2) \cong \varphi(\mathbf{Q}[x]) \subseteq \mathbf{R}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
