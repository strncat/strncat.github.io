As a reminder

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem (Recognition Theorem)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and \(A, N \leq G\). If
<ol>
	<li>\(A\) and \(N\) are normal subgroups of \(G\).</li>
	<li>\(A \cap N = \{e\}\)</li>
	<li>\(AN = G\)</li>
</ol>
Then, \(A \times N\) is isomorphic to \(G\). The isomorphism is given by
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: A \times N &amp;\rightarrow G \\
	 (a,n) &amp;\rightarrow an
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
But now the question is what happens if not all of these conditions are satisfied. Suppose that \(N\) was the only normal subgroup. In this case, \(G\) is called a semi-direct product of \(N\) and \(A\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = D_n\) where \(n \geq 3\) and \(|G| = 2n\). Let</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	N &amp;= \langle r \rangle, \ o(r) = n \\
	A &amp;= \langle j \rangle, \ o(j) = 2
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We know that \(N \cap A = \{e\}\) and \(A \cap N = G\). We also know that \(\langle r \rangle\) is a normal subgroup while \(\langle j \rangle\) is not. Remember that \(\langle r \rangle\) is normal since if we conjugate any rotation \(r^k\) by any flip, then the result is still a rotation \(jr^kj^{-1} = r^{-k} \in N\).
<br />
<br />
So the only thing missing to be able to apply the recognition theorem is that \(A\) is not normal. Despite this, we will show that we can still construct \(G = D_n\) from the subgroups \(N\), \(A\) and a homomorphism \(\gamma\).  In other words, \(G\) is isomorphic to \(N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\), \(G \cong N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\).
<br />
<br />
What is this homomorphism \(\gamma\)? \(\gamma\) will be a homomorphism from \(A\) to the group of automorphisms of \(N\). So for example, In \(A = \langle j \rangle\) (generated by \(j\)), we will send each element in an automorphism from the set \(\text{Aut}(N) = \text{Aut}(\langle r \rangle)\). Specifically</p>
<div>
	$$

<p>\(\gamma\) is a homomorphism of groups.

<h4><b>Construction of Semi-direct Products</b></h4>
<p>We haven’t said anything yet about how to actually construct \(G\) from the groups \(A\), \(N\) and \(\gamma\). The following will demonstrate this. (Important to note here that unlike the previous example, we don’t need \(A\) and \(N\) to be subgroups of \(G\). They are just groups!!!)
<br /></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Semi-direct Product Construction
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(A\) and \(N\) be groups and let
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\
	         a &amp;\rightarrow \gamma_a
	\end{align*}
	$$
be a homomorphism. Note here that not only \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism but also each \(\gamma_a\) is a homomorphism as well. Because of this, we will get that
<ol>
	<li>\(\gamma_a(n_1n_2) = \gamma_a(n_1) \cdot \gamma_a(n_2)\) for \(a \in A, n_1, n_2 \in N\).</li>
	<li>\(\gamma_{a_1a_2}(n) = \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n))\) for \(a_1, a_2 \in A, n \in N\).</li>
	<li>\(\gamma_{e} = id, \gamma_{a^{-1}} = (\gamma_a)^{-1}\).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Based on these facts, we can now define
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Semi-direct Product
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(G = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\) where the the product set is
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 G = N \times A = \{(n,a), n \in N, a \in A\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
The operation is
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(n_1, a_1) \cdot (n_2, a_2) = (n_1 \cdot \gamma_{a_1}(n_2), a_1a_2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
where \(n_1, n_2 \in N\) and \(a_1, a_2 \in A\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Recall that if this was a direct product, then the operation is \((n_1,a_1) \cdot (n_2,a_2) = (n_1n_2, a_1a_2)\) but here we have this application of \(\gamma_{a_1}\) on \(n_2\).
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We will show that \(G\) is a group by verifying the group properties.</p>
<ol>
    <!------------------------ASSOCIATIVITY--------------------------->
	<li>\(G\) is associative. The left hand side is
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	((n_1,a_1) \cdot (n_2,a_2)) \cdot (n_3,a_3) &amp;= (n_1 \gamma_{a_1}(n_2),a_1a_2) \cdot (n_3,a_3) \\
	                                            &amp;= (n_1 \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1a_2}(n_3),a_1a_2a_3).
													\end{align*}
	$$
</div>	
while the right hand side is
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(n_1,a_1) \cdot ((n_2,a_2) \cdot (n_3,a_3)) &amp;= (n_1,a_1) (n_1 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3),a_2a_3) \\
	                                            &amp;= (n_1, \gamma_{a_1}(n_2 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3)),  a_1a_2a_3).
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>	
	Recall the identities from the construction. Specifically, we saw that \(\gamma_a(n_1n_2) = \gamma_a(n_1) \cdot \gamma_a(n_2)\) and \(\gamma_{a_1a_2}(n) = \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n))\). Using this we see that term from the right hand side will equal to
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    \gamma_{a_1}(n_2 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3)) &amp;= \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n_3)) \\
		                                    &amp;= \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1a_2}(n_3)
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
which is the same as the term in the left hand side.
	</li>
    <!------------------------IDENTITIY--------------------------->
	<li>The identity element is \((e_N, e_A)\) (Exercise).</li>
    <!------------------------INVERSE--------------------------->
	<li>The inverse is \((n,a)^{-1} = (\gamma_{a^{-1}}(n^{-1}), a^{-1})\).</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(N\) and \(A\) be any groups. Define the trivial homomorphism as</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    \gamma_{tri}: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\
		                \gamma_{tri}(a) &amp;= id \quad \forall a \in A
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>Basically send any element to the identity function. Then, \(N \rtimes_{\gamma_{tri}} A = N \times A\). To see this, apply the operation and you’ll see that \((a_1, a_2)(n_1, n_2) = (n_1 id(n_2), a_1a_2) = (n_1n_2, a_1a_2)\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(N = \mathbf{Z}_n\) with the addition operation where \(n \geq 3\) and let \(A = \mathbf{Z}_2\). Define \(\gamma\) be</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_2 &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n)
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>As we remember from the previous lecture that \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n)\) is the modular units (mod n). We don’t have the trivial homomorphism. What can we do? We know that \(\mathbf{Z} = \{[0]_2, [1]_2\}\). We know we have to send \([0]\) to the identity element \([1]_n\). For \([1]_2\), we need to send it to an element of \(\Phi(n)\) which has order 2. As an example \([-1]_n\), has order 2 because \((-1)^2 = 1\). So</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_2 &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n) \\
		                 [0]_2  &amp;\rightarrow [1]_n \\
						 [1]_2	&amp;\rightarrow [-1]_n.
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>So now we have constructed \(G = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\). This is a group of order \(2n\). So it’s isomorphic to the dihedral group \(D_n\). We can replace \(N = \langle r \rangle\) where \(o(r)=n\) and \(A = \langle j \rangle\). We can set \(\gamma\) like before. So \(\gamma_{e_A} = id\) and \(\gamma_j = (r^k \rightarrow r^{-k})\).
<br />
<br />
Remark: If you have other elements of order 2 in \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n)\), then you can form “semi-dihedral groups”. For example, take \(N = \mathbf{Z}_8\), then Aut\((N) = \Phi(8) = \{1,3,5,7\}\). All the elements in this group is of order 2 except for 1. Therefore we can define</p>
<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
	    \gamma' : A=\langle j \rangle &amp;\rightarrow Aut(N) \cong \Phi(8) \\
		                           j   &amp;\rightarrow 3 \quad \text{ instead of -1}
		\end{align*}
		$$
</div>
<p>So now we’ll get a different semi-direct product. We’ll get \(G' = N \rtimes_{\gamma'} A\). \(|G'| = 16\). It is not isomorphic to \(D_8\). Also \(o(r) = 8\) and \(o(j) = 2\). But we have this new formula \(jr = r^3j\). (Instead of \(jr = jr^{-1})\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Recognition Theorem for Semi-direct Product</b></h4>
<p>So now we can state the Recognition Theorem but for Semi-direct Product.
<br /></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem (Recognition Theorem)

<div class="yellowbodydiv">

	<li>\(NA = G\)</li>
</ol>
Then, \(A \rtimes_{\gamma} N\) is isomorphic to \(G\). The isomorphism is given by
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\gamma: A \rtimes_{\gamma} N &amp;\rightarrow G \\

(Important to note here that unlike the previous example, we don’t need \(A\) and \(N\) to be subgroups of \(G\). They are just groups!!!) Semi-direct Product Construction Let \(A\) and \(N\) be groups and let $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\ a &amp;\rightarrow \gamma_a \end{align*} $$ be a homomorphism. Note here that not only \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism but also each \(\gamma_a\) is a homomorphism as well. Because of this, we will get that \(\gamma_a(n_1n_2) = \gamma_a(n_1) \cdot \gamma_a(n_2)\) for \(a \in A, n_1, n_2 \in N\). \(\gamma_{a_1a_2}(n) = \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n))\) for \(a_1, a_2 \in A, n \in N\). \(\gamma_{e} = id, \gamma_{a^{-1}} = (\gamma_a)^{-1}\). Based on these facts, we can now define Semi-direct Product Let \(G = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\) where the the product set is $$ \begin{align*} G = N \times A = \{(n,a), n \in N, a \in A\} \end{align*} $$ The operation is $$ \begin{align*} (n_1, a_1) \cdot (n_2, a_2) = (n_1 \cdot \gamma_{a_1}(n_2), a_1a_2) \end{align*} $$ where \(n_1, n_2 \in N\) and \(a_1, a_2 \in A\). Recall that if this was a direct product, then the operation is \((n_1,a_1) \cdot (n_2,a_2) = (n_1n_2, a_1a_2)\) but here we have this application of \(\gamma_{a_1}\) on \(n_2\). Proof We will show that \(G\) is a group by verifying the group properties. \(G\) is associative. The left hand side is $$ \begin{align*} ((n_1,a_1) \cdot (n_2,a_2)) \cdot (n_3,a_3) &amp;= (n_1 \gamma_{a_1}(n_2),a_1a_2) \cdot (n_3,a_3) \\ &amp;= (n_1 \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1a_2}(n_3),a_1a_2a_3). \end{align*} $$ while the right hand side is $$ \begin{align*} (n_1,a_1) \cdot ((n_2,a_2) \cdot (n_3,a_3)) &amp;= (n_1,a_1) (n_1 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3),a_2a_3) \\ &amp;= (n_1, \gamma_{a_1}(n_2 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3)), a_1a_2a_3). \end{align*} $$ Recall the identities from the construction. Specifically, we saw that \(\gamma_a(n_1n_2) = \gamma_a(n_1) \cdot \gamma_a(n_2)\) and \(\gamma_{a_1a_2}(n) = \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n))\). Using this we see that term from the right hand side will equal to $$ \begin{align*} \gamma_{a_1}(n_2 \gamma_{a_2}(n_3)) &amp;= \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1}(\gamma_{a_2}(n_3)) \\ &amp;= \gamma_{a_1}(n_2) \gamma_{a_1a_2}(n_3) \end{align*} $$ which is the same as the term in the left hand side. The identity element is \((e_N, e_A)\) (Exercise). The inverse is \((n,a)^{-1} = (\gamma_{a^{-1}}(n^{-1}), a^{-1})\). Example Let \(N\) and \(A\) be any groups. Define the trivial homomorphism as $$ \begin{align*} \gamma_{tri}: A &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(N) \\ \gamma_{tri}(a) &amp;= id \quad \forall a \in A \end{align*} $$ Basically send any element to the identity function. Then, \(N \rtimes_{\gamma_{tri}} A = N \times A\). To see this, apply the operation and you’ll see that \((a_1, a_2)(n_1, n_2) = (n_1 id(n_2), a_1a_2) = (n_1n_2, a_1a_2)\). Example Let \(N = \mathbf{Z}_n\) with the addition operation where \(n \geq 3\) and let \(A = \mathbf{Z}_2\). Define \(\gamma\) be $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_2 &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n) \end{align*} $$ As we remember from the previous lecture that \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n)\) is the modular units (mod n). We don’t have the trivial homomorphism. What can we do? We know that \(\mathbf{Z} = \{[0]_2, [1]_2\}\). We know we have to send \([0]\) to the identity element \([1]_n\). For \([1]_2\), we need to send it to an element of \(\Phi(n)\) which has order 2. As an example \([-1]_n\), has order 2 because \((-1)^2 = 1\). So $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_2 &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n) \\ [0]_2 &amp;\rightarrow [1]_n \\ [1]_2 &amp;\rightarrow [-1]_n. \end{align*} $$ So now we have constructed \(G = N \rtimes_{\gamma} A\). This is a group of order \(2n\). So it’s isomorphic to the dihedral group \(D_n\). We can replace \(N = \langle r \rangle\) where \(o(r)=n\) and \(A = \langle j \rangle\). We can set \(\gamma\) like before. So \(\gamma_{e_A} = id\) and \(\gamma_j = (r^k \rightarrow r^{-k})\). Remark: If you have other elements of order 2 in \(\text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n) \cong \Phi(n)\), then you can form “semi-dihedral groups”. For example, take \(N = \mathbf{Z}_8\), then Aut\((N) = \Phi(8) = \{1,3,5,7\}\). All the elements in this group is of order 2 except for 1.

	<li>\(A'\) and \(B'\) are normal subgroups of \(G\). To see this, observe that for \((a, e) \in A'\) and \((x, y) \in G\)</li>
	<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		(x, y)(a, e)(x, y)^{-1} =  (xax^{-1}, yey^{-1}) = (xax^{-1}, e) \in A'
		\end{align*}
		$$
	</div>
	<li>\(A' \cap B' = \{e_A, e_B\}\)</li>
	<li>\(A'B' = \{xy \ | \ x \in A', y \in B'\} = G\)</li>
</ul>
<p>From this, we have the following proposition
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem (Recognition Theorem)
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and \(A, B \leq G\). If
<ol>
	<li>\(A\) and \(B\) are normal subgroups of \(G\).</li>
	<li>\(A \cap B = \{e\}\)</li>
	<li>\(AB = G\)</li>
</ol>
Then, \(A \times B\) is isomorphic to \(G\). The isomorphism is given by
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\phi: A \times B &amp;\rightarrow G \\
	 (a,b) &amp;\rightarrow ab
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We need to show that \(\phi\) is a homomorphism and that it is surjective and injective. 
<br />
<br />
Claim: If \(a \in A, b \in B\), then \(ab = ba\). Note that this doesn’t say anything about whether \(G\), \(A\) or \(B\) are abelian. 
<br />
Proof: To see this, observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e \implies ab = ba
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is because we can just multiply by each element’s inverse on both sides. Now observe that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = (aba^{-1})b^{-1}\). We know that \(B\) is normal so \(aba^{-1} \in B\). \(b^{-1}\) is also in \(B\) since \(B\) is a subgroup. Therefore, \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in B\). Similarly, observe that that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = a(ba^{-1}b^{-1})\). \(A\) is normal so \(ba^{-1}b^{-1}\) is in \(A\). So \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A\). So now we have \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A\) and \(aba^{-1}b^{-1}\). This means that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A \cap B\). But \(A \cap B = \{e\}\) so \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e\) and therefore \(ab = ba\).
<br />
<br />
Now, to show that \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism, we want to show that \(\varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot (a_2,b_2)) = \varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot \varphi(a_2,b_2)\). The left hand side is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot (a_2,b_2)) = \varphi((a_1a_2, b_1b_2)) = a_1a_2b_1b_2.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>while the right hand side is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot \varphi(a_2,b_2) &amp;= a_1b_1 \cdot a_2b_2 \\
	                                        &amp;= a_1(b_1a_2)b_2 \\
											&amp;= a_1(a_2b_1)b_2 \quad \text{(by the claim we proved)} \\
											&amp;= a_1a_2b_1b_2.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. Next, we show that \(\varphi\) is surjective. But this is true by property (3) since \(AB = G\). Finally, we want to show that \(\varphi\) is injective. This is equivalent to showing that \(\ker(\varphi) = \{e\}\). By definition,</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(\varphi) = \{ (a,b) \in G \ | \ \varphi((a,b)) = ab = e \}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So we need all the products such that \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\) where \((a,b)=(e,e)\). So suppose \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\) and \(ab = e\). The trick here is to move everything to the other side so that \(a = b^{-1}\). Here, \(a \in A\) and \(b^{-1} \in B\). But \(A \cap B = \{e\}\). So \(a = b = e\). So \(\ker(\varphi) = \{(e,e)\}\). From this we see that it is an isomorphism as we wanted to show.

<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_{12}\). Let \(A = \langle [3] \rangle = \{[0],[3],[6],[9]\}\). Let \(B = \langle [3] \rangle = \{[0],[4],[8]\}\) Both \(A\) and \(B\) are subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}_{12}\). Check all three properties</p>

	<li>The product subset is \(A+B = \{x+y \in A, y \in B\} = G\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note here that we already know that \(\mathbf{Z}_3 \times \mathbf{Z}_4 \cong \mathbf{Z}_{12}\) by the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Automorphism of a group \(G\)</b></h4>
<p>An Automorphism of a group \(G\) is just an isomorphism from the group to itself. The identity map is the easiest example of an automorphism but there can be others.
<br />
<br />
Example: Let \(V = \{e, a, b, c\}\) (The Klien 4-group)(\(\cong \mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_2)\). We know that \(a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e\). The products are</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	ab &amp;= ba = c \\
	ac &amp;= ca = b \\
	bc &amp;= cb = a
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Now define \(\varphi: V \rightarrow V\) such that \(\varphi(e) = e\), \(\varphi(a) = b\), \(\varphi(b) = b\), \(\varphi(c)=a\). \(\varphi\) is an automorphism. This is because</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(\varphi\) is both injective and surjective so it is a bijection.</li>
	<li>\(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. We can check that \(\varphi(xy) = \varphi(x)\varphi(y)\)</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, there are six automorphisms of \(V\). Note here that the six automorphisms are basically permutations on the set of elements. There are exactly 24 permutations on a set of 4 elements. But we also need to satisfy the homomorphism condition. This means that for example, it will need to send the identity element to the identity element. So now how many permutations are available if the identity element is fixed? There are 6 permutations. In this example, this is also the answer to the number of automorphisms. 
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
The collection of automorphisms is called \(\text{Aut}(G) = \{\varphi: G \rightarrow G \ | \ \varphi \text{ is an  automorphism}\}\). This is a subgroup of the permutation group \(Sym(G)\) as we saw. Also note here that since Aut\((G)\) is a subgroup, then \(|\text{Aut}(G)|\) must divide \(G\) if \(G\) is finite. 
<br />
<br />
For example, we can see using the example above that Aut\((V)\) is isomorphic to \(S_3\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_n\) where \(n \geq 1\). Does this group have automorphisms other than the identity? <br />
For example, let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_{15}\). Define the following function</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi: \mathbf{Z}_{15} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_{15} \\
	            \varphi([x]) &amp;= [2x] = [2][x].
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>The claim is that \(\varphi\) is an automorphism. It is a homomorphism because</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi([x]+[y]) &amp;= \varphi([2]([x]+[y])) \\
	                 &amp;= \varphi([2][x]+[2][y]) \\
	                 &amp;= \varphi([x]) + \varphi([y]).
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>It is also a bijection. Note that we’re multiplying by \([2]\). In \(\mathbf{Z}_{15}\) (mod 15), \([2]\) has a multiplicate inverse since 2 and 15 are relatively prime. In fact, its multiplicative inverse is \([8]\) because \([2][8] = [16\%15] = [1]\). Therefore, to get the inverse, we just need to multiply by \([8]\).</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\varphi^{-1}([y]) = [8][y].
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Therefore, \(\varphi\) is a bijection. Thus, it is an automorphism. In fact, this generalizes to \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). Every modular unit mod n gives us an automorphism for \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). This is captured in the following proposition
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
\(\text{Aut}(G) \cong \Phi(n)\). The automorphism is given by
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	[a] &amp;\rightarrow \gamma(a) \\
	\gamma_{[a]}([x]) &amp;= [ax]
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p><br />
Note here that \(\gamma(a)\) is a function. The isomorphism is between a group of functions and the modular unit \(a\). 
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Suppose \(\varphi \in \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n)\). Let \([a] = \varphi([1])\). Then we can show that \(\varphi([x]) = [ax]\). 
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Example: What about \(\mathbf{Z}\)? What are the automorphism? Aut\((\mathbf{Z}) = \{\pm 1\}\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>More Automorphisms</b></h4>
<p>Some more definitions:
<br /></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition (The "conjugation by \(g\)" function)
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Given \(g \in G\), define \(c_g: G \rightarrow G\) by \(c_g(x) = gxg^{-1}\)
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Some facts about this function:</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(c_g \in \text{Aut}(G)\). So \(c_g\) is an automorphism and it has an inverse \(c^{-1}_g\). Furthermore, if \(G\) is abelian, then \(c_g = id\) because \(gxg^{-1}\) will reduce to just \(x\) when \(G\) is abelian</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also define the function</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	c: G &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(G) \\
	g &amp;\rightarrow c_g
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This function is a homomorphism. What does this mean? It means that conjugating by a product \(ab\) is the same as conjugating by \(a\) and then by \(b\). \(c_{ab} = c_a \circ c_b\).
<br />
<br />
Since it’s a homomorphism, we can check its kernel. It’s kernel is as follows</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\ker(c) = \mathbf{Z}(G)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Which is called the center of “G”.
<br />
<br />
Additionally, we have the subgroup \(c(G)\) which is the image of \(G\) under \(c\). \(c(G)\) is a subgroup of Aut\((G)\). This subgroup is usually called \(Inn(G)\) (subgroup of inner automorphism). Fact: Inn\((G)\) is a normal subgroup of Aut\((G)\).
<br />
<br />
Since Inn\((G)\) is normal, we can then form the quotient group Out\((G) = \text{Aut}/\text{Inn}(G)\). This group is called the outer automorphism.

Restating this Definition: Direct Products Suppose \(A\) and \(B\) are groups. Then the Direct Product: $$ \begin{align*} G = A \times B = \{(a,b) \ | \ a \in A, b \in B\} \end{align*} $$ With Operation: $$ \begin{align*} (a_1, b_1) \cdot (a_2, b_2) = (a_1a_2, b_1b_2) \end{align*} $$ is a group. The identity element \(e_{A \times B} = (a_G, b_H)\) and the inverse of \((a,b)\) is \((a^{-1},b^{-1})\). Observation: \(A' = \{(a,e_{b}) \ | \ a \in A \}\) and \(B' = \{(e_a,b) \ | \ b \in B \}\) are subgroups of \(G\). Moreover, \(A'\) is isomorphic to \(A\) and \(B'\) is isomorphic to \(B\). We also note that \(A'\) and \(B'\) are normal subgroups of \(G\). To see this, observe that for \((a, e) \in A'\) and \((x, y) \in G\) $$ \begin{align*} (x, y)(a, e)(x, y)^{-1} = (xax^{-1}, yey^{-1}) = (xax^{-1}, e) \in A' \end{align*} $$ \(A' \cap B' = \{e_A, e_B\}\) \(A'B' = \{xy \ | \ x \in A', y \in B'\} = G\) From this, we have the following proposition Theorem (Recognition Theorem) Let \(G\) be a group and \(A, B \leq G\). If \(A\) and \(B\) are normal subgroups of \(G\). \(A \cap B = \{e\}\) \(AB = G\) Then, \(A \times B\) is isomorphic to \(G\). The isomorphism is given by $$ \begin{align*} \phi: A \times B &amp;\rightarrow G \\ (a,b) &amp;\rightarrow ab \end{align*} $$ Proof We need to show that \(\phi\) is a homomorphism and that it is surjective and injective. Claim: If \(a \in A, b \in B\), then \(ab = ba\). Note that this doesn’t say anything about whether \(G\), \(A\) or \(B\) are abelian. Proof: To see this, observe that $$ \begin{align*} aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e \implies ab = ba \end{align*} $$ This is because we can just multiply by each element’s inverse on both sides. Now observe that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = (aba^{-1})b^{-1}\). We know that \(B\) is normal so \(aba^{-1} \in B\). \(b^{-1}\) is also in \(B\) since \(B\) is a subgroup. Therefore, \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in B\). Similarly, observe that that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = a(ba^{-1}b^{-1})\). \(A\) is normal so \(ba^{-1}b^{-1}\) is in \(A\). So \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A\). So now we have \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A\) and \(aba^{-1}b^{-1}\). This means that \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in A \cap B\). But \(A \cap B = \{e\}\) so \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e\) and therefore \(ab = ba\). Now, to show that \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism, we want to show that \(\varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot (a_2,b_2)) = \varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot \varphi(a_2,b_2)\). The left hand side is $$ \begin{align*} \varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot (a_2,b_2)) = \varphi((a_1a_2, b_1b_2)) = a_1a_2b_1b_2. \end{align*} $$ while the right hand side is $$ \begin{align*} \varphi(a_1,b_1) \cdot \varphi(a_2,b_2) &amp;= a_1b_1 \cdot a_2b_2 \\ &amp;= a_1(b_1a_2)b_2 \\ &amp;= a_1(a_2b_1)b_2 \quad \text{(by the claim we proved)} \\ &amp;= a_1a_2b_1b_2. \end{align*} $$ So \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. Next, we show that \(\varphi\) is surjective. But this is true by property (3) since \(AB = G\). Finally, we want to show that \(\varphi\) is injective. This is equivalent to showing that \(\ker(\varphi) = \{e\}\).

Check all three properties Are they normal? Yes because \(A\) and \(B\) are abelian since \(\mathbf{Z}_{12}\) is abelian. \(A \cap B = \{[0]\}\) since we listed the elements above. The product subset is \(A+B = \{x+y \in A, y \in B\} = G\) Note here that we already know that \(\mathbf{Z}_3 \times \mathbf{Z}_4 \cong \mathbf{Z}_{12}\) by the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

This is because \(\varphi\) is both injective and surjective so it is a bijection. \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. We can check that \(\varphi(xy) = \varphi(x)\varphi(y)\) In fact, there are six automorphisms of \(V\). Note here that the six automorphisms are basically permutations on the set of elements.

In this example, this is also the answer to the number of automorphisms. The collection of automorphisms is called \(\text{Aut}(G) = \{\varphi: G \rightarrow G \ | \ \varphi \text{ is an automorphism}\}\). This is a subgroup of the permutation group \(Sym(G)\) as we saw. Also note here that since Aut\((G)\) is a subgroup, then \(|\text{Aut}(G)|\) must divide \(G\) if \(G\) is finite. For example, we can see using the example above that Aut\((V)\) is isomorphic to \(S_3\). Example Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_n\) where \(n \geq 1\). Does this group have automorphisms other than the identity? For example, let \(G = \mathbf{Z}_{15}\). Define the following function $$ \begin{align*} \varphi: \mathbf{Z}_{15} &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_{15} \\ \varphi([x]) &amp;= [2x] = [2][x]. \end{align*} $$ The claim is that \(\varphi\) is an automorphism. It is a homomorphism because $$ \begin{align*} \varphi([x]+[y]) &amp;= \varphi([2]([x]+[y])) \\ &amp;= \varphi([2][x]+[2][y]) \\ &amp;= \varphi([x]) + \varphi([y]). \end{align*} $$ It is also a bijection.

Therefore, to get the inverse, we just need to multiply by \([8]\). $$ \begin{align*} \varphi^{-1}([y]) = [8][y]. \end{align*} $$ Therefore, \(\varphi\) is a bijection. Thus, it is an automorphism. In fact, this generalizes to \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). Every modular unit mod n gives us an automorphism for \(\mathbf{Z}_n\). This is captured in the following proposition Proposition \(\text{Aut}(G) \cong \Phi(n)\). The automorphism is given by $$ \begin{align*} [a] &amp;\rightarrow \gamma(a) \\ \gamma_{[a]}([x]) &amp;= [ax] \end{align*} $$ Note here that \(\gamma(a)\) is a function. The isomorphism is between a group of functions and the modular unit \(a\). Proof Suppose \(\varphi \in \text{Aut}(\mathbf{Z}_n)\). Let \([a] = \varphi([1])\). Then we can show that \(\varphi([x]) = [ax]\). Example: What about \(\mathbf{Z}\)? What are the automorphism? Aut\((\mathbf{Z}) = \{\pm 1\}\) More Automorphisms Some more definitions: Definition (The "conjugation by \(g\)" function) Given \(g \in G\), define \(c_g: G \rightarrow G\) by \(c_g(x) = gxg^{-1}\) Some facts about this function: \(c_g \in \text{Aut}(G)\). So \(c_g\) is an automorphism and it has an inverse \(c^{-1}_g\). Furthermore, if \(G\) is abelian, then \(c_g = id\) because \(gxg^{-1}\) will reduce to just \(x\) when \(G\) is abelian We can also define the function $$ \begin{align*} c: G &amp;\rightarrow \text{Aut}(G) \\ g &amp;\rightarrow c_g \end{align*} $$ This function is a homomorphism. What does this mean? It means that conjugating by a product \(ab\) is the same as conjugating by \(a\) and then by \(b\). \(c_{ab} = c_a \circ c_b\). Since it’s a homomorphism, we can check its kernel. It’s kernel is as follows $$ \begin{align*} \ker(c) = \mathbf{Z}(G) \end{align*} $$ Which is called the center of “G”. Additionally, we have the subgroup \(c(G)\) which is the image of \(G\) under \(c\). \(c(G)\) is a subgroup of Aut\((G)\). This subgroup is usually called \(Inn(G)\) (subgroup of inner automorphism). Fact: Inn\((G)\) is a normal subgroup of Aut\((G)\). Since Inn\((G)\) is normal, we can then form the quotient group Out\((G) = \text{Aut}/\text{Inn}(G)\). This group is called the outer automorphism. References MATH417 by Charles Rezk Algebra: Abstract and Concrete by Frederick M.

<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let’s take the previous example but slightly modify it so that \(G = \langle a \rangle\) where \(o(a) = 2\) and \(H = \langle b \rangle\) with \(o(b) = 3\). So now we’re get 6 elements instead in the group</p>

<br />
<br />
Why was this example different? why was this one cyclic. Because 2 and 3 are prime numbers. \(a\) has order \(2\) and \(b\) is of order \(3\). To get to the identity element, we will need a power that is the least common multiple which is 6.
<br />
<br />
We can formalize this idea in the next proposition
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(a, b \geq 1\). The formula 
$$
\begin{align*}
\gamma(x) = ([x]_a, [x]_b)
\end{align*}
$$
defines a homomorphism \(\gamma: \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) such that
$$
\begin{align*}
\ker(\gamma) = \mathbf{Z}m \ \text{ (multiples of $m$ where } m=lcm(a,b)).
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
First note that \(\gamma\) is well defined. Next, we want to show that \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism. Since we’re working on \(\mathbf{Z}_a\) and \(\mathbf{Z}_b\), then we want to show that \(\gamma(x+y) = \gamma(x) + \gamma(y)\). Observe that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\gamma(x+y) &amp;= ([x+y]_a, [x+y]_b) \\
            &amp;= ([x]_a + [y]_a, [x]_b, [y]_b) \\
			&amp;= ([x]_a, [x]_b) + ([y]_a, [y]_b) \\
			&amp;= \gamma(x) + \gamma(y) \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Next, we want to show that the kernel is the set of multiples of \(m\) so \(\ker(\gamma) = \mathbf{Z}m\) where \(m = lcm(a,b)\). By definition,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\ker(\gamma) &amp;= \{x \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \gamma(x) = ([x]_a, [x]_b) = ([0]_a, [0]_b)\}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>In other words, we want \(x\) such that \(x \equiv 0 (\bmod a)\) and \(x \equiv 0 (\bmod b)\) divides \(x\). That is \(a\) divides \(x\) and \(b\) divides \(x\). This is the set of multiples of \(m\). Therefore</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\ker(\gamma) &amp;= \mathbf{Z}a \cap \mathbf{Z}b = \mathbf{Z}m.

<h4><b>A New Homomorphism</b></h4>
<p>As a consequence of this, we will get an injective homomorphism from the quotient group \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}m\) which is \(\mathbf{Z}_m\) to \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) as follows</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{Z}_m &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b  \\
                        [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_a, [x]_b)

$$
</div>
<p>Why? Recall that we defined a homomorphism \(\gamma\) from \(\mathbf{Z}\) to \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\). Its kernel \(K = \mathbf{Z}m\). By the Homomorphism Theorem, we get another homomorphism from the quotient group \(\mathbf{Z}/K\) to the same target group \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\). Also recall that since \(\ker(\gamma) = K = \mathbf{Z}m\), then the new homomorphism is also injective.
<br />
<br />
When will the homomorphism be surjective? Since it’s injective, then it suffices that to show that \(|\mathbf{Z}_m| = |\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b|\). So when will they have the same size?

<h4><b>The Multiplicative Group</b></h4>
<p>Recall \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) is not just a group but a ring with two operations addition and multiplication. Inside this ring, we can focus on the elements that have a multiplicative inverse and form \(\Phi(n) = \{u \in \mathbf{Z}_n \ |\) u has a multiplicative inverse \(\} \subseteq \mathbf{Z}_n\). \((\Phi(n),\cdot)\) is a group with the multiplication operation. This group is also abelian and is called “modular units”. It is not a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}_n\).
<br />
<br />
It turns out that we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to decompose \(\Phi(n)\), the modular units group. Before listing the theorem recall that if \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\). Then \([x]_n \in \Phi(n)\) if and only if \(gcd(x,n)=1\). 
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
If \(a, b \geq 1\), \(gcd(a, b) = 1\) and \(m = ab\). Then there is an isomorphism
$$
\begin{align*}
\Phi(m) &amp;\rightarrow \Phi(a) \times \Phi(b) \\
[x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_{a}, [x]_{b})

<b>Proof</b>

Recall the isomorphism we established earlier</p>

$$

\gamma: \mathbf{Z}_m &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b \\
[x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_{a}, [x]_{b})

$$
\begin{align*}
(u_1, v_1) \cdot (u_2, v_2) = (u_1u_2, v_1v_2)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>where \(u_1, u_2 \in \mathbf{Z}_a\) and \(v_1,v_2 \in \mathbf{Z}_b\). The two operations (addition and multiplication) make \(R = \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) a ring. We have two claims:
<br />
<br />
Claim 1: \(\gamma(xy) = ([xy]_a, [xy]_b)\)
<br />
This is true because we know \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism. So</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\gamma(xy)=\gamma(x)\gamma(y) &amp;= ([x]_a, [x]_b)\cdot ([y]_a, [y]_b) \\

                             &amp;= ([xy]_a, [xy]_b).
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Claim 2: The function \(\gamma\) restricts to a function</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\gamma' : \Phi(m) \rightarrow \Phi(a) \times \Phi(b)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>which is a bijection. why?</p>
<ul>
<li>if \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\) such that \([x]_m \in \Phi(m)\), then we know that \(gcd(x,m) = 1\). We defined \(m = ab\). So if \(x\) is relatively prime to \(m\), then it must be relatively prime to the factors of \(m\), so \(gcd(x,b) = 1\). This means that \([x]_a \in \Phi(a)\) and \([x]_b \in \Phi(b)\). </li>
<li>\(\gamma'\) is injective because \(\gamma\) is an injective function.</li>
<li>\(\gamma'\) is surjective. \(\gamma\) is a bijection so every element of \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) has the form \([x]_a, [x]_b\) for some \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\). This means that \(gcd(x,a) = 1 = gcd(x, b)\). So \(gcd(x,ab) = 1\).</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: \(\Phi(30) \cong \Phi(6) \times \Phi(5) \cong \Phi(2) \times \Phi(3) \times \Phi(5)\). Then we can analyze each of these groups. So</p>
<div>

There are other ways to construct groups like the following Definition: Direct Products Suppose \(G\) and \(H\) are groups. Then the Direct Product: $$ \begin{align*} G \times H = \{(g,h) \ | \ g \in G, h \in H\} \end{align*} $$ With Operation: $$ \begin{align*} (g_1, h_1) \cdot (g_2, h_2) = (g_1g_2, h_1h_2) \end{align*} $$ is a group. The identity element \(e_{G \times H} = (e_G, e_H)\) and the inverse of \((g,h)\) is \((g^{-1},h^{-1})\). You can verify that this is indeed a group (Exercise). Example Let \(G = \langle a \rangle\) where \(o(a) = 2\) and \(H = \langle b \rangle\) with \(o(b) = 2\). Then $$ \begin{align*} G \times H = \{ (e,e), (a,e), (e,b), (a,b)\} \end{align*} $$ Note that this is a group. Since it has four elements then it must be isomorphic to either \(V\) ( symmetries of the rectangle) or the cyclic one (so we need an element of order 4).

Properties of Direct Product Groups These are some facts about direct product groups Proposition Let \(G\) and \(H\) be groups. Then the size of \(G \times H\) is \(|G \times H| = |G||H|\). Proposition Let \(G_1 \cong G_2\) and \(H_1 \cong H_2\) be groups. Then \(G_1 \times H_1 \cong G_2 \times H_2\). Proof To show that two groups are isomorphic, we need to provide an isomorphism between the two groups. Since we know that \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) are isomorphic, then let \(\alpha : G_1 \rightarrow G_2\) be an isomorphism. Similarly, since \(H_1\) and \(H_2\) are isomorphic, then let \(\beta : H_1 \rightarrow H_2\) be an isomorphism. Then we claim that $$ \begin{align*} \gamma : G_1 \times H_1 &amp;\rightarrow H_2 \times G_2 \\ \gamma(g, h) &amp;= (\alpha(g), \beta(h)). \end{align*} $$ is an isomorphism. [TODO … verify] Generalizing Direct Products We can generalize the definition of direct products to say Definition: Generalized Direct Products Suppose \(G_1, G_2,...,G_r\) are groups. Then $$ \begin{align*} \bar{G} &amp;= G_1 \times G_2 \times .... \times G_r \\ &amp;= \{(g_1, g_2,...,g_r) \ | \ g_i \in G_i\} \end{align*} $$ With Operation: $$ \begin{align*} (g_1, g_2, ..., g_r) \cdot (g'_1,g'_2, ..., g'_r) = (g_1g'_1, g_2g'_2, ..., g_rg'_r) \end{align*} $$ is a group. Example Let’s take the previous example but slightly modify it so that \(G = \langle a \rangle\) where \(o(a) = 2\) and \(H = \langle b \rangle\) with \(o(b) = 3\). So now we’re get 6 elements instead in the group $$ \begin{align*} G \times H = \{ (e,e), (a,e), (e,b), (a,b), (e,b^2), (a, b^2)\} \end{align*} $$ This group is cyclic. It must contain an element of order 5 that generates the group. If we let \((a, b) = x\), then we’ll see that $$ \begin{align*} (a,b) \cdot (a,b) &amp;= (e, b^2) = x^2 \\ (e, b^2) \cdot (a,b) &amp;= (a, e) = x^3 \\ (a, e) \cdot (a,b) &amp;= (e, b) = x^4 \\ (e, b) \cdot (a,b) &amp;= (a, b^2) = x^5. \end{align*} $$ At some point when we get to \(x^4\), we know by Lagrange, that the order of the element will be 6. This group is in fact isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_3 \cong \mathbf{Z}_6\). Why was this example different? why was this one cyclic. Because 2 and 3 are prime numbers. \(a\) has order \(2\) and \(b\) is of order \(3\). To get to the identity element, we will need a power that is the least common multiple which is 6. We can formalize this idea in the next proposition Proposition Let \(a, b \geq 1\). The formula $$ \begin{align*} \gamma(x) = ([x]_a, [x]_b) \end{align*} $$ defines a homomorphism \(\gamma: \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) such that $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\gamma) = \mathbf{Z}m \ \text{ (multiples of $m$ where } m=lcm(a,b)). \end{align*} $$ Proof First note that \(\gamma\) is well defined. Next, we want to show that \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism. Since we’re working on \(\mathbf{Z}_a\) and \(\mathbf{Z}_b\), then we want to show that \(\gamma(x+y) = \gamma(x) + \gamma(y)\).

By definition, $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\gamma) &amp;= \{x \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \gamma(x) = ([x]_a, [x]_b) = ([0]_a, [0]_b)\}. \end{align*} $$ In other words, we want \(x\) such that \(x \equiv 0 (\bmod a)\) and \(x \equiv 0 (\bmod b)\) divides \(x\). That is \(a\) divides \(x\) and \(b\) divides \(x\). This is the set of multiples of \(m\). Therefore $$ \begin{align*} \ker(\gamma) &amp;= \mathbf{Z}a \cap \mathbf{Z}b = \mathbf{Z}m. \end{align*} $$ where \(m = lcm(a,b) = \frac{ab}{gcd(a,b)}\). A New Homomorphism As a consequence of this, we will get an injective homomorphism from the quotient group \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}m\) which is \(\mathbf{Z}_m\) to \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) as follows $$ \begin{align*} \mathbf{Z}_m &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b \\ [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_a, [x]_b) \end{align*} $$ Why? Recall that we defined a homomorphism \(\gamma\) from \(\mathbf{Z}\) to \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\). Its kernel \(K = \mathbf{Z}m\). By the Homomorphism Theorem, we get another homomorphism from the quotient group \(\mathbf{Z}/K\) to the same target group \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\). Also recall that since \(\ker(\gamma) = K = \mathbf{Z}m\), then the new homomorphism is also injective. When will the homomorphism be surjective? Since it’s injective, then it suffices that to show that \(|\mathbf{Z}_m| = |\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b|\). So when will they have the same size? Theorem If \(a, b \geq 1\) and \(gcd(a,b) = 1\). Then we have an isomorphism $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_m &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b, \quad (m = ab)\\ [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_a, [x]_b) \end{align*} $$ Fact: the reverse, if \(gcd(a,b) &gt; 1\), then \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b \not\cong \mathbf{Z}_{ab}\).

So now we can generalize our previous theorem to Theorem If \(a_1, a_2, ... a_r \geq 1\) and \(gcd(a_i, a_j) = 1\) if \(i \neq j\).

Then there is an isomorphism $$ \begin{align*} \Phi(m) &amp;\rightarrow \Phi(a) \times \Phi(b) \\ [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_{a}, [x]_{b}) \end{align*} $$ Proof Recall the isomorphism we established earlier $$ \begin{align*} \gamma: \mathbf{Z}_m &amp;\rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b \\ [x]_m &amp;\rightarrow ([x]_{a}, [x]_{b}) \end{align*} $$ This worked with addition. But it is also compatible with multiplication. We didn’t define multiplication on ordered pairs. So define it as follows. $$ \begin{align*} (u_1, v_1) \cdot (u_2, v_2) = (u_1u_2, v_1v_2) \end{align*} $$ where \(u_1, u_2 \in \mathbf{Z}_a\) and \(v_1,v_2 \in \mathbf{Z}_b\). The two operations (addition and multiplication) make \(R = \mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) a ring. We have two claims: Claim 1: \(\gamma(xy) = ([xy]_a, [xy]_b)\) This is true because we know \(\gamma\) is a homomorphism. So $$ \begin{align*} \gamma(xy)=\gamma(x)\gamma(y) &amp;= ([x]_a, [x]_b)\cdot ([y]_a, [y]_b) \\ &amp;= ([x]_a[y]_a, [x]_b[y]_b) \\ &amp;= ([xy]_a, [xy]_b). \end{align*} $$ Claim 2: The function \(\gamma\) restricts to a function $$ \begin{align*} \gamma' : \Phi(m) \rightarrow \Phi(a) \times \Phi(b) \end{align*} $$ which is a bijection. why? if \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\) such that \([x]_m \in \Phi(m)\), then we know that \(gcd(x,m) = 1\). We defined \(m = ab\). So if \(x\) is relatively prime to \(m\), then it must be relatively prime to the factors of \(m\), so \(gcd(x,b) = 1\). This means that \([x]_a \in \Phi(a)\) and \([x]_b \in \Phi(b)\). \(\gamma'\) is injective because \(\gamma\) is an injective function. \(\gamma'\) is surjective. \(\gamma\) is a bijection so every element of \(\mathbf{Z}_a \times \mathbf{Z}_b\) has the form \([x]_a, [x]_b\) for some \(x \in \mathbf{Z}\). This means that \(gcd(x,a) = 1 = gcd(x, b)\). So \(gcd(x,ab) = 1\). Example: \(\Phi(30) \cong \Phi(6) \times \Phi(5) \cong \Phi(2) \times \Phi(3) \times \Phi(5)\). Then we can analyze each of these groups. So $$ \begin{align*} \Phi(5) &amp;\cong \{e\} \\ \Phi(5) &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}_2 \\ \Phi(5) &amp;\cong \mathbf{Z}_4. \end{align*} $$ References MATH417 by Charles Rezk Algebra: Abstract and Concrete by Frederick M.

Correspondence Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup of \(G\). There is a bijection between \(B \leq G/N\) and the subgroup \(\pi^{-1}B\) (pre-image of \(B\) which is a subgroup of \(G\)).
$$
\begin{align*}
B \leq G/N \longrightarrow \pi^{-1}B
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Recall that we defined the quotient homomorphism to be</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi \ : \ G &amp;\rightarrow G/N \\ 
       \pi(x) &amp;= xN.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Also Recall the the pre-image of \(B\) is \(\pi^{-1}(B) = \{g \in G \ | \ \pi(g) \in B\}\) which we showed previously to be a subgroup of \(G\).
<br />
<br />
Additionally, the theorem also claims that the normal subgroups of \(G/N\) correspond to the normal subgroups in \(G\) containing \(N\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) and \(N = \mathbf{Z}6\) (multiples of 6). Therefore \(G/N = \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}6 = \mathbf{Z}_6\). Here is a breakdown of the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}\). Within all of these subgroups you’ll see the \(\mathbf{Z}6\). The subgroups in the red outline will correspond to the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}6 = \mathbf{Z}_6\) on the left side.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec17/2.png" width="90%" class="center" /></p>
<p>Take another example. Suppose that \(N = \mathbf{Z}2\). Recall the definition of \(\pi\):</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi \ : \ \mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow (\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2 = \mathbf{Z}_2) \\ 
       \pi(x) &amp;= x + \mathbf{Z}2.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>For example \(x = 3\) and \(x = 6\). Then</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi(3) = 3 + \mathbf{Z}2 &amp;= \{...,3 + -4, 3 + -2, 3 + 0, 3 + 2, 3 + 4,...\} \\
                          &amp;= \{..., -1, 1, 3, 5, 7...\} = [1]_2 \\
\pi(6) = 6 + \mathbf{Z}2 &amp;= \{...,6 + -4, 6 + -2, 6 + 0, 6 + 2, 6 + 4,...\}  \\
                          &amp;= \{...,2, 4, 6, 8, 10...\} = [0]_2
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>In general, we will have exactly two cosets. Again \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2\) partitions \(\mathbf{Z}\) into two cosets. The coset of the even numbers and the coset of the odd numbers.
<br />
<br />
Now, we want to take their pre-image. Here the possible subsets in \(\mathbf{Z}_2\) are \([0]_2\) and \([1]_2\). BUT, the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}_2\) are only \(\{[0]\}\) and \(\mathbf{Z}_2\). \([1]\) is NOT a subgroup. So \(B = \{\{[0]\}, \mathbf{Z}_2\}\) in</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi^{-1}(B) = \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in B\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Applying it on each subgroup, we see that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi^{-1}(\{[0]\}) &amp;= \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in \{[0]\}\} \\
              &amp;= \{-4, -2, 0, 2, 4,.... \} \\
			  &amp;= \mathbf{Z}2 \\
\pi^{-1}(\mathbf{Z}_2)  &amp;= \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in \mathbf{Z}_2\} \\
              &amp;= \mathbf{Z}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So we see here that there is a bijective correspondance between \(\{[0]\}\) which is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2 = \mathbf{Z}_2\) and \(\mathbf{Z}2\) which is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}\). 
<br />

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof of the Correspondence Theorem</b></h4>
<p>So again, we want to show that there is a bijection between the subgroup \(d\) of the quotient group \(G/N\) and the subgroup of \(G\) which contain \(N\)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec17/1.png" width="80%" class="center" /></p>
<p>One way to show that there is a bijection is to show that we have an inverse function.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can send a subgroup of the quotient group \(B \leq G/N\) its pre-image \(\pi^{-1}(B)\). We can easily show that \(\pi^{-1}(B)\) is a subgroup of \(G\). Recall that \(B\) is a collection of cosets \(B = \{gN \ | gN \leq G/N\}\) because it's a subgroup of the quotient group. The pre-image of \(B\) are elements of \(G\) such that they're the elements that make up the cosets. So if \(B =\{eN, aN, bN\}\), then its pre-image is \(\{e, a,b\}\) which is a subgroup of \(G\). Note here that we must have the identity element \(eN \in B\) since it's a subgroup. So we can see here that \(N\) is definitely contained in \(G\).</li>
<li>To go the other way. Suppose we have a subgroup of \(A \leq G\) containing \(N\). Now, to relate it to a subgroup inside \(G/N\), take its image under \(\pi\). We know \(\pi(A)\) by definition are the cosets \(\{\pi(a)=aN \ | \ a \in A\}\). \(\pi(A)\) is a subgroup of \(G/N\).</li>
</ul>
<p>So now we need to check two things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If \(B \leq G/N\), then \(\pi(\pi^{-1}(B)) = B\).</li>
	<li>If \(A \leq G\), then \(\pi^{-1}(\pi(A)) = A\).</li>
</ul>
<p>Remark: If we don’t know that \(A\) contains \(N\), then if \(A \leq G\), we can show that \(\pi(\pi(A)) = AN = \{an \ | \ a, n \in N\}\)

<h4><b>General Correspondance Theorem</b></h4>
<p>There is a more general correspondance theorem (the way it is listed in the book) which says
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Correspondence Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(\varphi: G \rightarrow H\) is a surjective homomorphism and \(N = \ker(\phi)\). Then, there is a bijection correspondance between the subgroups of \(H\) and the subgroups of \(G\) which contain \(N\).
</div>
<p><br />
Recall that by the Isomorphism Theorem, that \(H \approx G/N\). By the previous Correspondance Theorem, we showed that subgroups of \(G/N\) correspond to subgroups of \(G\) containing \(N\). So we’ll have this picture</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec17/3.png" width="100%" class="center" /></p>
<p>So we have \(H \approx G/N\) by the Isomorphism Theorem and then we have the second part of the picture by the Correspondance Theorem.

<h4><b>Factorization Theorem</b></h4>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Factorization Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(N \leq K \leq G\) where \(N\) and \(K\) are normal subgroups in \(G\). Define the surjective homomorphism
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi \ : \ G/N &amp;\rightarrow G/K \\

$$
So this homomorphism takes the \(N\) coset of \(x\) to the \(K\) coset of \(x\). From this, we get an isomorphism between \((G/N) / (K/N)\) and \(G/K\) so \((G/N) / (K/N) \approx G/K\) where \(\ker(\varphi) = K/N\).
</div>
<p><br />
Note here that the kernel \(K/N\) is a subgroup of \(G/N\). The kernel consists of all the cosets in \(G/N\) such that if we apply the homomorphism, we get the identity coset in \(G/K\). In fact (show this (Exercise))</p>

If \(A, B \leq G\), then \(AB\) is a subgroup if and only if \(AB = BA\).

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
\(\Rightarrow:\) Suppose that \(AB\) is a subgroup of \(G\). We want to show that \(AB = BA\). Let \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\). So \(x = ab \in AB\). But \(AB\) is a subgroup, so \(x^{-1} \in AB\).

(x^{-1})^{-1} &amp;= (a'b')^{-1} \\
 x &amp;= (b')^{-1}(a')^{-1} \\

$$
</div>
<p>But this shows that \((b')^{-1}(a')^{-1} \in BA\). This implies that \(AB \subseteq BA\). Now, suppose that \(x \in BA\). So \(x = ba\) where \(b \in B\) and \(a \in A\). Write \(ba = (eb)(ae)\). We know that \(eb \in AB\) and \(ea \in AB\), so \((eb)(ae)\) must be in \(AB\) since \(AB\) is a subgroup. So \(BA \subseteq AB\). This proves that \(AB = BA\) as we wanted to show.

\(\Leftarrow:\) Now suppose that \(AB = BA\). We want to show that \(AB\) is a subgroup of \(G\).</p>
<ol>
	<li>\(e \in AB\). This is because \(e \in A\) and \(e \in B\) so \(ee = e \in AB\).</li>
	<li>\(x, y \in AB\) implies that \(xy \in AB\). Suppose that \(a,a' \in A\) and \(b,b' \in B\). Then \(aba'b' = a(ba')b'\). \(ba' \in AB = BA\) by the hypothesis. So we can re-write \(ba'\) as \(a''b''\) for some \(a'' \in A\) and \(b'' \in B\). So now \(a(ba')b' = aa''b''b \in AB\)</li>
	<li>For Any \(x \in AB\), \(x^{-1} \in AB\). If \(x \in AB\), then \(x \in BA\) by the hypothesis. So write \(x = ba\) so \(x^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}\). This means that \(x^{-1} \in AB\).</li>

Recall that if \(G\) is a group and \(N\) was a normal subgroup of \(G\). And then we had a homomorphism \(\varphi: G \rightarrow H\) such that the kernel of \(\phi\) is contained in \(N\) (or easier to remember, \(\phi(N) = \{e\}\)). Then we get $$ \begin{align*} \varphi':G/N &amp;\rightarrow H \\ \phi'(xn) &amp;= \phi(x) \end{align*} $$ Then we studied the Isomorphism Theorem which requires additionally that the homomorphism \(\varphi:G \rightarrow H\) to be surjective as well as \(N = \ker(\varphi)\). Then, this will then get us an isomorphism \(\varphi': G/N \rightarrow H\). The Correspondence Theorem relates the subgroups of the quotient group \(G/N\) to the subgroups of \(G\) that contain \(N\). The theorem claims that there is a bijection or a bijective correspondance between the two groups. Correspondence Theorem Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup of \(G\). There is a bijection between \(B \leq G/N\) and the subgroup \(\pi^{-1}B\) (pre-image of \(B\) which is a subgroup of \(G\)). $$ \begin{align*} B \leq G/N \longrightarrow \pi^{-1}B \end{align*} $$ Recall that we defined the quotient homomorphism to be $$ \begin{align*} \pi \ : \ G &amp;\rightarrow G/N \\ \pi(x) &amp;= xN. \end{align*} $$ Also Recall the the pre-image of \(B\) is \(\pi^{-1}(B) = \{g \in G \ | \ \pi(g) \in B\}\) which we showed previously to be a subgroup of \(G\). Additionally, the theorem also claims that the normal subgroups of \(G/N\) correspond to the normal subgroups in \(G\) containing \(N\). Example Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) and \(N = \mathbf{Z}6\) (multiples of 6). Therefore \(G/N = \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}6 = \mathbf{Z}_6\). Here is a breakdown of the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}\). Within all of these subgroups you’ll see the \(\mathbf{Z}6\). The subgroups in the red outline will correspond to the subgroups of \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}6 = \mathbf{Z}_6\) on the left side. Take another example. Suppose that \(N = \mathbf{Z}2\). Recall the definition of \(\pi\): $$ \begin{align*} \pi \ : \ \mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow (\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2 = \mathbf{Z}_2) \\ \pi(x) &amp;= x + \mathbf{Z}2. \end{align*} $$ For example \(x = 3\) and \(x = 6\). Then $$ \begin{align*} \pi(3) = 3 + \mathbf{Z}2 &amp;= \{...,3 + -4, 3 + -2, 3 + 0, 3 + 2, 3 + 4,...\} \\ &amp;= \{..., -1, 1, 3, 5, 7...\} = [1]_2 \\ \pi(6) = 6 + \mathbf{Z}2 &amp;= \{...,6 + -4, 6 + -2, 6 + 0, 6 + 2, 6 + 4,...\} \\ &amp;= \{...,2, 4, 6, 8, 10...\} = [0]_2 \end{align*} $$ In general, we will have exactly two cosets. Again \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2\) partitions \(\mathbf{Z}\) into two cosets. The coset of the even numbers and the coset of the odd numbers. Now, we want to take their pre-image.

So \(B = \{\{[0]\}, \mathbf{Z}_2\}\) in $$ \begin{align*} \pi^{-1}(B) = \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in B\} \end{align*} $$ Applying it on each subgroup, we see that $$ \begin{align*} \pi^{-1}(\{[0]\}) &amp;= \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in \{[0]\}\} \\ &amp;= \{-4, -2, 0, 2, 4,.... \} \\ &amp;= \mathbf{Z}2 \\ \pi^{-1}(\mathbf{Z}_2) &amp;= \{g \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ \pi(g) \in \mathbf{Z}_2\} \\ &amp;= \mathbf{Z} \end{align*} $$ So we see here that there is a bijective correspondance between \(\{[0]\}\) which is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}2 = \mathbf{Z}_2\) and \(\mathbf{Z}2\) which is a subgroup of \(\mathbf{Z}\).

Define the surjective homomorphism $$ \begin{align*} \varphi \ : \ G/N &amp;\rightarrow G/K \\ xN &amp;\rightarrow xK \end{align*} $$ So this homomorphism takes the \(N\) coset of \(x\) to the \(K\) coset of \(x\). From this, we get an isomorphism between \((G/N) / (K/N)\) and \(G/K\) so \((G/N) / (K/N) \approx G/K\) where \(\ker(\varphi) = K/N\). Note here that the kernel \(K/N\) is a subgroup of \(G/N\). The kernel consists of all the cosets in \(G/N\) such that if we apply the homomorphism, we get the identity coset in \(G/K\). In fact (show this (Exercise)) $$ \begin{align*} K/N = \{xN \ | \ \varphi(xN) = ek\} = \{xN \ | \ xN \leq K\} \end{align*} $$ Product Subsets Definition (Product Subsets) Let \(G\) be a group with subsets \(A, B \subseteq G\). Then $$ \begin{align*} AB &amp;= \{ab \ | \ a \in A, b \in B\} \subseteq G \\ BA &amp;= \{ba \ | \ b \in B, a \in A \} \subseteq G. \end{align*} $$ If \(A\) and \(B\) are subgroups of \(G\), then we can have \(AB \neq BA\). We can also have \(AB\) and \(BA\) not be subgroups themselves. Example Suppose \(G = S_3\). Then $$ \begin{align*} A &amp;= \langle (1 \ 2) \rangle = \{e, (1 \ 2)\} \\ B &amp;= \langle (1 \ 3) \rangle = \{e, (1 \ 3)\}. \end{align*} $$ Then $$ \begin{align*} AB &amp;= \{e, (1 \ 2), (1 \ 3), (1 \ 3 \ 2)\} \\ BA &amp;= \{e, (1 \ 3), (1 \ 2), (1 \ 2 \ 3)\}. \end{align*} $$ We can observe that \(AB\) is not a subgroup of \(G\) because it is not closed. Another reason is that the order of \(AB\) is 4 while the group size \(|S_3| = 6\) and 4 doesn’t divide 6. \(BA\) is also not a subgroup since it has 4 elements. This leads to the next proposition. Proposition If \(A, B \leq G\), then \(AB\) is a subgroup if and only if \(AB = BA\). Proof \(\Rightarrow:\) Suppose that \(AB\) is a subgroup of \(G\). We want to show that \(AB = BA\). Let \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\). So \(x = ab \in AB\). But \(AB\) is a subgroup, so \(x^{-1} \in AB\). We can write \(x^{-1} = a'b'\) where \(a' \in A\) and \(b' \in B\). Take the inverse of \(x^{-1}\) to see that $$ \begin{align*} (x^{-1})^{-1} &amp;= (a'b')^{-1} \\ x &amp;= (b')^{-1}(a')^{-1} \\ \end{align*} $$ But this shows that \((b')^{-1}(a')^{-1} \in BA\). This implies that \(AB \subseteq BA\). Now, suppose that \(x \in BA\). So \(x = ba\) where \(b \in B\) and \(a \in A\). Write \(ba = (eb)(ae)\). We know that \(eb \in AB\) and \(ea \in AB\), so \((eb)(ae)\) must be in \(AB\) since \(AB\) is a subgroup. So \(BA \subseteq AB\). This proves that \(AB = BA\) as we wanted to show. \(\Leftarrow:\) Now suppose that \(AB = BA\). We want to show that \(AB\) is a subgroup of \(G\). \(e \in AB\). This is because \(e \in A\) and \(e \in B\) so \(ee = e \in AB\). \(x, y \in AB\) implies that \(xy \in AB\). Suppose that \(a,a' \in A\) and \(b,b' \in B\). Then \(aba'b' = a(ba')b'\). \(ba' \in AB = BA\) by the hypothesis. So we can re-write \(ba'\) as \(a''b''\) for some \(a'' \in A\) and \(b'' \in B\). So now \(a(ba')b' = aa''b''b \in AB\) For Any \(x \in AB\), \(x^{-1} \in AB\). If \(x \in AB\), then \(x \in BA\) by the hypothesis. So write \(x = ba\) so \(x^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}\). This means that \(x^{-1} \in AB\). Diamond Isomorphism Theorem Diamond Isomorphism Theorem If \(A, N \leq G\) where \(N\) is normal, then \(AN = NA\). \(AN \leq G\). \(N\) is normal in \(AN\). \(A \cap N \leq A\), \(A \cap N\) is normal in \(A\). \(A/N \approx A/A \cap N\).

Homomorphism Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup. Let \(\pi: G \rightarrow G/N\) be a homomorphism and let \(\phi : G \rightarrow H\) be a homomorphism.<br /> 
Let \(K = ker(\phi)\) be a normal subgroup such that \(N \subseteq K\). Then <br />
There exists a homomorphism \(\varphi': G/N \rightarrow H\) with formula

\begin{align*}
\varphi'(aN) = \varphi(a)

and 
$$
\begin{align*}
ker(\varphi') &amp;= K/N = \{aN \ | aN \subseteq K\} \unlhd G/N \\
\phi'(G/N) &amp;= \phi(G) \leq H
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
In a picture, once we have the requirement \(N \subseteq K\) where \(K = ker(\phi)\), then we get this homomorphism \(\varphi'\) between \(H\) and \(G/N\). This new homomorphism \(\phi'\) is unique.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec16/1.png" width="90%" class="center" /></p>

<p>In short, we’re following a recipe to construct a homomorphism. Given a homomorphism \(\varphi \ : \ G \rightarrow H\) and a normal subgroup \(N\) that is a subset of \(ker(\varphi) = K\) (which means that \(\varphi(N) = \{e\}\) since every element in the kernel is sent to the identity). THEN, we get another homomorphism \(\varphi\) from \(G/N\) to \(H\). The homomorphism is given by \(\varphi'(aN) = \varphi(a)\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof</b></h4>
<p>(1) First we need to check that \(\varphi'\) is well defined. This means that want to show that if \(aN = bN\) (in \(G/N\)), then \(\varphi'(a) = \varphi'(b)\) which is \(\varphi(a) = \varphi(b)\) in \(H\) by how we defined \(\varphi'\) above. Re-write \(aN = bN\) as</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    aN &amp;= bN \\
	b^{-1}aN &amp;= N.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So \(b^{-1}a \in N\). Now we can apply \(\varphi\) on it to get</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    \varphi(b^{-1}a) &amp;= \varphi(b^{-1})(a) \quad \text{(since $\varphi$ is a homomorphism)} \\
    e &amp;= \varphi(b^{-1})(a) \quad \text{(since $N \subseteq K$)} \\
    \varphi(b) &amp;= (a).
	
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So it’s well defined as we wanted to show. \(\blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
(2) Next, we want to show that it is a homomorphism. To see that observe that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    \varphi'(aN \cdot bN) &amp;= \varphi(abN) \quad \text{(def of quotient function)} \\
	                      &amp;= \varphi(ab) \quad \text{(def of $\varphi'$)} \\
						  &amp;= \varphi(a)\varphi(b) \quad \text{(def of a homomorphism)} \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>On the other hand</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    \varphi'(aN)\varphi'(bN) &amp;= \varphi(a)\varphi(b) \quad \text{(def of $\varphi'$)} \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>And so we’re done. \(\blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
(3) Finally, we need to prove the conclusions of the theorem. The second statements claims that \(\phi'(G/N) = \phi(G)\). But this is true by how we defined \(\varphi'\). For the first statement which claims that \(ker(\varphi') = K/N = \{aN \ | \ aN \subseteq K\}\). First, we know that by the definition of the kernel that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
    ker(\varphi') &amp;= \{aN \ | \ \varphi'(aN) = e_H \} \\
	              &amp;= \{aN \ | \ \varphi(a) = e_H \} \quad \text{(by def of $\varphi'$)} \\
				  &amp;= \{aN \ | \ a \in ker(\phi) = K \} \quad \text{($\varphi(a)=e$ so $a$ is in the kernel)} 
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Notice now that \(N\) is a subgroup of \(K\). This means that any coset of \(N\) will be contained in the corresponding coset of \(K\) so \(aN \subseteq aK\). But here it is the trivial coset so \(aK = eK = K\).

<h4><b>Isomorphism Theorem</b></h4>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Isomorphism Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup. Let \(\pi: G \rightarrow G/N\) be a homomorphism and let \(\phi : G \rightarrow H\) be a <b>surjective</b> homomorphism.<br /> 
Let \(K = ker(\phi)\) be a normal subgroup such that \(N = K\) (unlike before where \(N \subseteq K\)). Then <br />
There there is a isomorphism \(\varphi': G/N \rightarrow H\) with formula (same as before)
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi'(aN) = \varphi(a)
\end{align*}
$$
Unlike before, now \(\phi'(G/N) = H\) and the kernel \(ker(\varphi') = \{eN\}\) (the trivial coset of \(N\)).
</div>
<p><br />
So we have the same conditions as before except that \(N = K\) and the \(\phi\) is surjective. So we can apply the homomorphism theorem from before and we’ll get the same results as before. That is, a homomorphism \(\phi'\). But now since \(\phi\) is surjective and its image is the same as the image of \(\phi'\), then \(\phi'\) is also surjective. 
<br />
<br />
Moreover, its kernel per the homomorphism theorem is \(\{aN \ | \ aN \subseteq K\}\) (collection of all cosets of \(N\) that are contained in \(K\)). But now \(N = K\). There is only one coset of \(N\) contained in \(N\) which is the trivial coset \(eN\). so \(ker(\phi') = \{eN\}\). This implies that \(\phi'\) is injective. So \(\phi'\) is now a bijection which means that it’s an isomorphism. 
<br />
<br /></p>

<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Let \(H = \langle a \rangle\) be a finite cyclic group of order \(n\). </li>
<li>Let \(G = (\mathbf{Z}, +)\). </li>
<li>Let \(N = \mathbf{Z}n \unlhd \mathbf{Z}\) the group of multiples of \(n\) which is a subgroup of \(G = \mathbf{Z}\).</li>
<li>Let \(\phi: \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow H \) be a surjective homomorphism by the formula \(\phi(m) = a^m\)</li>
<li>The kernel of \(\phi\) is \(ker(\phi) = \{m \in \mathbf{Z} \ | \ a^m = e\}\). The kernel is the set of all the multiples of the order of \(\langle a \rangle\) so it's \(\mathbf{Z}n\) where \(n\) is the order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying the Isomorphism Theorem, we get a new isomorphism</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi' \ : \ &amp;\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}n \rightarrow H = \langle a \rangle \\
              &amp;[m]_n \rightarrow a^m.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Reminder: \(\mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}n = \mathbf{Z}_n\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Let \(\mathbf{F}^{x} = \mathbf{F} \ \{0\}\). </li>
<li>Let \(GL_n(\mathbf{F}) = \{ A \in Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbf{F})\) such that \(A\) is invertible\(\}\) with matrix multiplication. </li>
<li>Let \(\phi: GL_n(\mathbf{F}) \rightarrow \mathbf{F}^{x} \) be a homomorphism by the formula \(\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)\). Is the determinant surjective? for any number \(a \in \mathbf{F}\), can we find a matrix satisfying such that its determinant is \(a\)? Yes! consider
$$
\begin{align*}
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; 0 &amp; ... &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; ... &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}
$$
The determinant of this matrix is \(a\). So this homomorphism is surjective.
</li>
<li>The kernel of \(\phi\) is the set of invertible matrices such that their determinant is the identity matrix. \(ker(\phi) = \{A \in GL_n(F) \ | \ \det(a) = 1\}\). This set is called the special linear group or \(SL_n(\mathbf{F})\) In fact it is a normal subgroup of \(GL_n(F)\).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Isomorphism Theorem tells us that \(GL_n(\mathbf{F})/SL_n(\mathbf{F})\) is isomorphic to  \(\mathbf{F}^{x}\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 3</b></h4>
<p>We’re going to show that \(S_4 / N \approx S_3\). 
<br />
<br />
To do this, we’re going to produce a homomorphism from \(S_4\) to \(S_3\). But \(S_3\) is isomorphic to \(Sym(X)\) where \(X\) has 3 elements.
<br />
<br />
\(S_4\) is the set of permutations of a 4 element set. There is a trick that we can use to construct interesting homomorphisms out of a permutation group which is to find structures on the set that we’re permuting. For example define \(X\) to be the set of partitions of \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\) into two disjoint subsets of 2 each. So</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
   &amp;\quad \ \quad S_1 \quad \quad S_2 \quad \quad S_3 \\
X &amp;= \{12|34, 13|24, 14|23\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So we have 3 different ways of grouping these 4 elements. Suppose now we have a permutation in \(S_4\) as follows</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So now let’s apply \(g\) on the three elements in \(X\)</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
S_1 &amp;= 12|34 \xrightarrow{g} 23|14 = 14|23 = S_3 \\
S_2 &amp;= 13|24 \xrightarrow{g} 21|34 = 12|34 = S_1 \\
S_3 &amp;= 14|23 \xrightarrow{g} 24|31 = 13|24 = S_2.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So for the first example, we’re given \(12|34\). We’ll look up where each element goes in \(g\). For example 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3, 3 goes 1 and 4 stays fixed. So that’s exactly what we get which is \(S_3\).
<br />
<br />
So the permutation \(g\) sends \(S_1\) to \(S_3\), \(S_2\) to \(S_1\) and \(S_3\) to \(S_2\).</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}

\xrightarrow{\varphi}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Let’s now take another permutation \(g'\) in \(S_4\)</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g' = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
3 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So now let’s apply \(g'\) on the three elements in \(X\)</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
S_1 &amp;= 12|34 \xrightarrow{g} 21|43 = 12|23 = S_1 \\
S_2 &amp;= 13|24 \xrightarrow{g} 31|42 = 13|24 = S_2 \\
S_3 &amp;= 14|23 \xrightarrow{g} 41|32 = 14|23 = S_3.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So \(g'\) just takes \(X\) to itself</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
g = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
3 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}

\xrightarrow{\varphi}

\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
=
id \in S_3
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So here are some claims about \(\varphi\)</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(\varphi\) is a homomorphism from \(S_4\) to \(S_3\).</li>
	<li>\(\varphi\) is surjective. Recall that \(|S_4| = 24\) while \(|S_3| = 6\). (We still need to check (homework))</li>
	<li>\(K = ker(\phi)\) is a normal subgroup of \(S_4\). We can further deduce the order of \(K\). How? We know by the Isomorphism Theorem that the quotient group \(S_4/K\) is isomorphic \(S_3\) because \(\varphi\) is a surjective homomorphism and \(K\) is a normal subgroup. This tells us that these two groups have the same size. Since \(K\) is normal, we also know that the quotient group is the number of cosets. But by Lagrange's Theorem we know that \(\frac{|S_4|}{|K|}\) is equal to the number of cosets. So \(\frac{|S_4|}{|K|} = |S_4/K| = |S_3|\). Therefore, we see that \(|K| = 4\).</li>
	<li>In fact \(K = \{e, (1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 4)(2 \ 3), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4)\} \)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice here that we first proved that \(|K| = 4\) before finding the elements in \(K\). It’s just easier to verify that some element is in the kernel rather than finding the elements first.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 4</b></h4>
<p>Suppose that \(n \geq 3\). Let \(D_{2n}\) be the symmetries of regular \(2n\)-gon (even number of vertices.)<br /> 
We already know that if we have a symmetry of an \(n-\)gon, we get a permutation of its vertices. But there are other ways to construct a homomorphism. Consider the following homomorphism</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi \ : \ D_{2n} \rightarrow Sym(X) \approx S_n
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>where \(X\) be the set of diagonals of the polygon. For example, for \(n = 3\), we have 6 vertices. But we let’s think of the diagonals. We have 3 diagonals. Notice here that any symmetry will take a diagonal to another diagonal. If we label the diagonals, then a rotation will take diagonal 1 to diagonal 2 for example and diagonal 2 to diagonal 3 as shown below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec16/2.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>In fact, this homomorphism is surjective.</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi \ : \ D_{6} \rightarrow S_3
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>The kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup of \(D_6\) and by the Isomorphism Theorem, the quotient group \(D_6/K\) is isomorphic to \(S_3\). How big is \(K\)? \(D_6\) has 12 elements and \(S_3\) has 6 elements. So \(K\) must have \(2\) elements. The kernel is \(\{e, r^3\}\).

<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(H\) be a subgroup. For \(a, b \in G\), define \(a \sim_H b\) to mean 
$$
\begin{align*}
b = ah \quad \text{ for some } h \in H

In other words, \(a \sim_H b\) if \(a^{-1}b \in H\).

We claim that \(\sim_H\) is an equivalence relation. [Exercise: Prove it]
<br />
<br />
The equivalence classes are the left cosets \(aH = \{ah \ | \ h \in H\}\).

<br />
Now define \(G / H\) to be the collection of left \(H\)-cosets in \(G\) so \(G / H = \{ aH \ | \ a \in G\}\). Define the Quotient function as follows</p>

<p>So \(\pi\) sends an element to the coset it is contained in. Of course we can do the same thing for right cosets. We need a different notation so we’ll use a backward slash for right cosets \(G \backslash H\). So \(G \backslash H = \{ Ha \ | \ a \in G\}\). The Quotient function is</p>

     &amp;\pi'(g) = Hg
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) and let \(H = \mathbf{Z}n\) where \(n \geq 0\) (multiples of \(n\)). Then the set of left cosets is</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
G / H &amp;= \{[a]_n \ | \ a \in \mathbf{Z}\} \\
      &amp;= \mathbf{Z}_n
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Side note: Why? so say \(H = \mathbf{Z}3\), then \(H = \{...,-6,-3,0,3,6,9,...\}\) and the left cosets are</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
0 + H, 1 + H, 2 + H, 3 + H, ...
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>For example</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
0 + H &amp;= \{...,-6,-3,0,3,6,9,...\} = [0]_3 \\
1 + H &amp;= \{...,-5,-2,1,4,7,10,...\} = [1]_3 \\
2 + H &amp;= \{...,-4,-1,2,5,8,11,...\} = [2]_3 \\
3 + H &amp;= \{...,-3,0,3,6,9,12,...\} = 0 + H \\
4 + H &amp;= \{...,-2,1,4,7,10,13,...\} = 1 + H \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>From this we see that \(3H = 0H\), \(4H = 1H\) and so on. There are exactly 3 distinct left cosets. These three left cosets are exactly \(Z_3 = \{[0], [1], [2]\}\).
<br />
<br />
So now we see that \(G / H = \mathbf{Z}_n\). This is a group. In fact \(\pi \ : \ \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}n\) is a homomorphism.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Quotient Function</b></h4>
<p>The question now is if we can do this in general. If we have a group \(G\) and a subgroup \(H \leq G\). We want to put a group structure on the set of left \(H\)-cosets, \(G / H\) such that \(\pi \ : \ G \rightarrow G / H\) is a homomorphism? This is called the “Quotient Group”.
<br />
<br />
Also if we make that happen and \(\pi\) is a homomorphism. What would the kernel of \(\pi\) be? By definition:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
ker(\pi) &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ \pi(g) = e_{G/H}\} \\
         &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = e_{G/H}\} \quad \text{(By def, $\pi(a) = aH$)} \\
         &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = \pi(e_G)\} \quad \text{($\pi$ is a homomorphism so $\pi(e_G) = e_{G/H}$)} \\
         &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = eH\} \quad \text{(by def of $\pi$ again)} \\
		 &amp;= H.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>But we also know that kernels are normal subgroups so this means that \(H\) must be a normal subgroup. So if we make \(\pi\) a homomorphism, then we’ll see that \(H\) is actually a normal subgroup. [Is this right?]
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Quotient Group</b></h4>
<p>Now suppose we have a group \(G\) and a normal subgroup \(N\). Define \(G/N\) to be the set of all left cosets of \(N\) so \(G/N = \{ aN \ | \ a \in G \}\). In fact since \(N\) is normal, the left cosets are the right cosets so we don’t need to say left or right in the definition. Let’s also define a group operation on the group \(G/N\).</p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup. Define the operation on \(G/N\) by
$$
\begin{align*}
aN \cdot bN = (ab)N
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
The goal is to show that \((G / N, \cdot)\) is a group. But first we need to show that the operation we defined is well-defined (We also want to show that this operation is a homomorphism later). So we need to show that if \(aN = a'N\) and \(bN = b'N\), then \((ab)N = (a'b')N\).
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof (well-defined)</b>
<br />
Since \(aN = a'N\), then \(a'\) is in the coset \(aN\) and we can write \(a' = an_1\) for some \(n_1 \in N\). Similarly, \(bN = b'N\) so we can write \(b' = bn_2\) for some \(n_2 \in N\). We want to show that \(a'b' = abn\) for some \(n \in N\). Now,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
a'b' &amp;= an_1bn_2 \\
     &amp;= a(bb^{-1})n_1bn_2 \\
	 &amp;= (ab)(b^{-1}n_1bn_2)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>So now we want to show that \(b^{-1}n_1bn_2 \in N\). We know that \(N\) is a normal subgroup. So if we conjugate \(n\) by \(b^{-1}\), then we know that \(b^{-1}nb \in N\) because \(N\) is normal. Moreover, \((b^{-1}nb)(n_2) \in N\) since \(N\) is a subgroup. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof (\((G/N, \cdot)\) is a group)</b>
<br />
To show this, we need to verify the group properties</p>
<ol>
	<li>Associative: We want to show that \((aN \cdot bN) \cdot cN = aN \cdot (bN \cdot cN)\)
		<div>
		$$
		\begin{align*}
		(aN \cdot bN) \cdot cN &amp;= abN \cdot cN \\
		                       &amp;= (ab)cN \\
							   &amp;= a(bc)N \quad \text{(multiplication is associative)} \\
							   &amp;= aN \cdot (bN \cdot cN).
		\end{align*}
		$$
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>Identity: The identity element is \((eN)\)</li>
	<li>Inverses: We want to show that \((aN)^{-1}\) is an inverse of \(aN\).</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, \((G/N, \cdot)\) is a group.
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof (homomorphism)</b>
<br />
Next we want to show that \(\pi: G \rightarrow G/N\) is a homomorphism with kernel \(ker(\pi) = N\). Recall that \(\pi(a) = aN\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = D_4 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j\}\). We established the identities \(r^4 = e = j^2\) and \(jr = r^{-1}j\). We first claim that \(N = \langle r^2 \rangle = \{e, r^2\}\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\). Why? For any \(g \in D_4\), we have \(g r^2 g^{-1} \in \langle r^2 \rangle\).
<br />
<br />
Since \(N\) is normal, then we can form the quotient group \(G / N\) where</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	G/N = D_4/N = \{eN, rN, jN, rjN\}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Note that the other possibilities end up being the same as one of the four cosets above. For example \(r^2N = eN\) and \(r^3N = rN\). Note also that this matches Lagrange’s Theorem. By Lagrange, we expect to have \(|G|/|N|\) cosets. \(|G| = 8\) and \(|N| = 2\) so we indeed have 4 elements.
<br />
<br />
Since \(D_4/N\) has 4 elements, then we expect this group to be isomorphic to either the cyclic group of order 4 or the non-cyclic one. How do we know? We can calculate the order of the elements in the group. If there is an element of order 4, then it’s cyclic. If there is not, then it can’t be cyclic. For example \((rN)^2 = r^2N = eN\). Why? \(r^2N\) is the coset</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\{r^2(e), r^2(r^2)\} = \{r^2, e\} = eN.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>What about \((jN)^2\)?</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(jN)^2=j^2N = eN.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Next, \((rjN)^2 = (rj)^2N\) But \(rj\) is a flip so it’s square is \(e\) and so \((rjN)^2 = eN\). So every element’s square is the identity and no element has order 4. So it’s isomorphic to \(V\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<p>Now consider \(D_6 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j, r^5j\}\). Consider \(N = \langle r^3 \rangle = \{e, r^3\}\) which is a normal subgroup of \(D_6\). Why is it normal? Because if we conjugate it with any element from \(D_6\), we will get the same set</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	r^k r^3 r^{-k} &amp;= r^3 \\
	rj r^3 (rj)^{-1} &amp;= jr^{-1} r^3 r j^{-1} = r^3 \\
	....
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This is actually because \(r^3g = gr^3\) for all \(g \in G\). This is a property of \(r^3\). (in this case \(r^3\) is called “central”). Moreover, \(G/N\) will have \(|G|/|H| = 6\) cosets.</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	G/N = D_6 / \langle r^3 \rangle = \{eN, rN, r^2N, jN, rjN, r^2jN\}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>As a reminder, because \(N\) is a normal subgroup, \(G/N\) is a group. It’s a group of order 6. There are two groups of order 6. The abelian cyclic one and \(D_3\) which is isomorphic to \(S_3\). To determine which one, we need to find the order of the elements. Any flip will have order two and so it turns out that \(jN, rjN, r^2jN\) all have order 2. \(eN\) has order 1. For the rest</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	(rN)^3 = r^3N = \{(r^3)e, (r^3)r^3\} = \{e, r^3\} = eN.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>In fact, \(r^2N\) has order 3 as well. So none of the elements have order 6 and so this group is not cyclic. It is in fact isomorphic to \(D_3\).
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 3</b></h4>
<p>Now consider \(G = (\mathbf{R}, +)\) and \(H = (\mathbf{Z}, +)\). \(G\) is abelian. Therefore, all of its subgroups are normal and \(H\) is normal. Now let’s form the quotient group as follows</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	G/H = \mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z} = \{a + \mathbf{Z} \ | \ a \in \mathbf{R}\}.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(a + \mathbf{Z} = [a] = \{a + n \ | \ n \in \mathbf{Z}\}\) is a \(\mathbf{Z}\) coset of \(a\). For example if \(a = \frac{1}{3}\), then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\frac{1}{3} + \mathbf{Z} = \{...,-1 + \frac{1}{3}, 0 + \frac{1}{3}, 1 + \frac{1}{3}, ...\} \subseteq \mathbf{R}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(G/H\) is a group under addition where \([a] + [b] = [a + b]\). This group is abelian. What is this group isomorphic to? 
<br />
<br />
Let \(T\) be the set of rotations around the \(z\) axis so \(T = \{r_{\theta} = Rot_{e_3}(\theta) \ | \ \theta \in \mathbf{R}\}\). This is a subgroup of \(SO(3)\). Note here that \(r_{\theta + 2\pi n} = r_{\theta}\). It turns out that \(\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}\) is isomorphic to \(T\). The isomorphism is</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow T \\
	[x] &amp;\rightarrow r_{2\pi x}
	\end{align*}
	$$

<h4><b>Example 4</b></h4>
<p>Let \(F\) be a field. (\(F = \mathbf{R}\) or \(\mathbf{C}\) or \(\mathbf{Z}p\), \(p\) is prime). Now let</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	GL_n(F) = \{ A \in Mat_{n \times n}(F) \ | \ A^{-1} \text{ exists }\}

</div>
<p>Why is this a normal subgroup? because you can pull out scalars in matrix multiplication so \(A^{-1}cA = cA^{-1}A = cI\).
We can form the quotient group</p>

<h4><b>Symmetric Groups</b></h4>
<p>We want to know what the normal subgroups of symmetric groups are. In order to do so, we want to see what happens if we conjugate a permutation \(\tau\) with element so \(\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\)?
<br />
<br />
In turns out in symmetric groups, there is a way to understand conjugation. We actually have a formula. This formula is called the <b>cycle conjugation formula</b>. Given \(\tau = (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... a_k) \in S_n\) where \(\tau\) is a permutation consisting of a \(k-\)cycle with \(a_1,a_2... \in \{1,2,....,n\}\). Then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} &amp;= (b_1 \ b_2 \ ... b_k) \quad \text{where } b_i = \sigma(a_i) \\
	                                         &amp;= (\sigma(a_1) \ \sigma(a_2) \ ...\ \sigma(a_k))
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So we actually get another \(k\) cycle.
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We want to show that 
\(\sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} = (\sigma(a_1) \ \sigma(a_2) \ ... \ \sigma(a_k))\). We will compute the new permutation directly. Let \(x \in \{1,2,...,n\}\). It turns out that there are two cases.
<br />
<br />
Case 1: \(x = \sigma(a_i)\):<br />
So now we’ll apply the permutation on \(x\). First we apply \(\sigma^{-1}\) but since \(x = \sigma(a_i)\), then we will just get \(a_i\). Next, we’ll apply the cycle and here we’ll get \(a_{i+1}\) since it’s a cycle. Lastly, we need to apply \(\sigma\). So we get \(\sigma(a_{i+1})\). (There is a subtlety here because \(a_{i+1}\) for \(i = k\), is \(i = 1\). To fix this, we’ll let \(a_{k+1} = 1\) or just have two cases). So in summary:</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} (x) &amp;= \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} (\sigma(a_i)) \\
	                                               &amp;= \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) (a_i) \\
												   &amp;=  \begin{cases} a_{j+1} \quad &amp;\text{if } j \neq k \\ a_1 \quad \quad &amp;\text{if } j = k\end{cases}

	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Case 2: \(x \neq \sigma(a_i)\) for any \(i\)<br />
Apply \(\sigma^{-1}\) to get \(\sigma^{-1}(x) \neq a_i\) for any \(i\). This means that the cycle actually doesn’t do anything to \(x\). So \(x\) is in fact fixed. So</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} (x) &amp;= \sigma ( \sigma^{-1} (a_i)) \\
	                                               &amp;= x.

	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>From Case 1 and Case 2, we see that \(\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\) is the \(k\)-cycle \((\sigma(a_1) \ \sigma(a_2) \ ...\ \sigma(a_k))\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Cycle Conjugation Formula Application</b></h4>
<p>Suppose we have an element \(\tau = \tau_1 \tau_2 ... \tau_r \in S_n\) where each \(\tau_i\) is a cycle. Now suppose we have another element \(\sigma\). Then</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} &amp;= \sigma \tau_1 \tau_2 ... \tau_r \sigma^{-1} \\
	                        &amp;= \sigma \tau_1 (\sigma^{-1}\sigma) \tau_2 (\sigma^{-1}\sigma) ... (\sigma^{-1}\sigma) \tau_r \sigma^{-1} \\
							&amp;= (\sigma \tau_1 \sigma^{-1}) (\sigma \tau_2 \sigma^{-1}) \sigma ... \sigma^{-1} (\sigma \tau_r \sigma^{-1}) \\
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So if we have a permutation \(\tau\) that has a cycle decomposition and therefore a cycle type (cycle decomposition meaning that it can be decomposed into disjoint cycles). Then if we conjugate the permutation, the conjugate will also have exactly the same cycle type as \(\tau\). So two facts
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Fact
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
\(\forall \ \sigma, \tau \in S_n\), \(\tau\) and \(\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\) have the same cycle type.
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Fact
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(\tau, \tau' \in S_n\) have the same cycle type. Then \(\tau' = \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\) for some \(\sigma \in S_n\). 
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 1</b></h4>
<p>For example, let \(\sigma = (1 \ 3 \ 4 \ 7 \ 2 \ 5) \in S_9\) and let \(\tau = (2 \ 9)(1 \ 8 \ 7)\). If we conjugate \(\tau\) with \(\sigma\), then we know by the previous fact that the cycle type will remain the same. This means that we will get a 3-cycle followed by a 2-cycle \((a_1 \ a_2 \ a_3)(a_4 \ a_5)\). Furthermore, to figure out these new numbers. We just apply sigma on \(\tau\), meaning that we permute the elements in \(\tau\) according to \(\sigma\). For example, \(\sigma\) sends 2 to 5. so we’ll replace 2 with 5 in \(\tau\). \(\sigma\) doesn’t do anything to 6 so it just stays and so on.</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sigma &amp;= (1 \ 3 \ 4 \ 7 \ 2 \ 5) \\
	\tau &amp;= (2 \ 9)(1 \ 8 \ 7) \\
	\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} &amp;= (5 \ 6)(3 \ 8 \ 2)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>We can also ask, given \(\tau\) and given \(\tau' = (5 \ 6)(3 \ 8 \ 2)\). How can we produce \(\sigma\) such that \(\tau' = \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\)? For this, it is easier to right \(\sigma\) using the two notation. So now we will look at \(\tau\) see that the first element is 2 and 2 goes to 5 in \(\tau'\). The second element is 9 and to goes to 6 in \(\tau'\) (position wise) and so. Therefore</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\tau &amp;= (2 \ 9)(1 \ 8 \ 7) \\
	\tau' &amp;= (5 \ 6)(3 \ 8 \ 2) \\
	\sigma &amp;= 
	\begin{pmatrix}
	1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\
	3 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 9 &amp; 6 &amp; 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 7
	\end{pmatrix}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Notice that for the other elements 3. We don’t care where it goes as long it goes somewhere. As a reminder, \(\sigma\) is not unique and there could be many \(\sigma\)’s such that \(\tau = \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\).
<br />
<br /></p>

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example 2</b></h4>
<p>Let \(G = S_3\) and \(N = \{e, (1 \ 2 \ 3), (1 \ 3\ 2)\} \leq S_3\).
<br />
<br />
Observation: A subgroup \(H \leq S_n\) is normal if and only if whenever \(g \in H\), then so is every element with the same cycle type as \(g\). 
<br />
<br />
Based on this, \(H = \{e, (1 \ 2)\} \leq S_3\). \(H\) is not normal since it doesn’t have all the elements of the same cycle type. Other normal subgroups of \(S_n\) are \(\{e\}\), \(A_n = ker(sgn)\) even permutations. And if \(n = 4\), \(K = \{e, (1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4), (1 \ 4),(2 \ 3)\}\).

For \(a, b \in G\), define \(a \sim_H b\) to mean $$ \begin{align*} b = ah \quad \text{ for some } h \in H \end{align*} $$ In other words, \(a \sim_H b\) if \(a^{-1}b \in H\). We claim that \(\sim_H\) is an equivalence relation. [Exercise: Prove it] The equivalence classes are the left cosets \(aH = \{ah \ | \ h \in H\}\). Now define \(G / H\) to be the collection of left \(H\)-cosets in \(G\) so \(G / H = \{ aH \ | \ a \in G\}\). Define the Quotient function as follows $$ \begin{align*} \pi \ : \ &amp;G \rightarrow G / H \\ &amp;\pi(g) = gH. \end{align*} $$ So \(\pi\) sends an element to the coset it is contained in. Of course we can do the same thing for right cosets. We need a different notation so we’ll use a backward slash for right cosets \(G \backslash H\). So \(G \backslash H = \{ Ha \ | \ a \in G\}\). The Quotient function is $$ \begin{align*} \pi' \ : \ &amp;G \rightarrow G \backslash H \\ &amp;\pi'(g) = Hg \end{align*} $$ Example Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) and let \(H = \mathbf{Z}n\) where \(n \geq 0\) (multiples of \(n\)). Then the set of left cosets is $$ \begin{align*} G / H &amp;= \{[a]_n \ | \ a \in \mathbf{Z}\} \\ &amp;= \mathbf{Z}_n \end{align*} $$ Side note: Why? so say \(H = \mathbf{Z}3\), then \(H = \{...,-6,-3,0,3,6,9,...\}\) and the left cosets are $$ \begin{align*} 0 + H, 1 + H, 2 + H, 3 + H, ... \end{align*} $$ For example $$ \begin{align*} 0 + H &amp;= \{...,-6,-3,0,3,6,9,...\} = [0]_3 \\ 1 + H &amp;= \{...,-5,-2,1,4,7,10,...\} = [1]_3 \\ 2 + H &amp;= \{...,-4,-1,2,5,8,11,...\} = [2]_3 \\ 3 + H &amp;= \{...,-3,0,3,6,9,12,...\} = 0 + H \\ 4 + H &amp;= \{...,-2,1,4,7,10,13,...\} = 1 + H \\ \end{align*} $$ From this we see that \(3H = 0H\), \(4H = 1H\) and so on. There are exactly 3 distinct left cosets. These three left cosets are exactly \(Z_3 = \{[0], [1], [2]\}\). So now we see that \(G / H = \mathbf{Z}_n\). This is a group. In fact \(\pi \ : \ \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}/\mathbf{Z}n\) is a homomorphism. Quotient Function The question now is if we can do this in general. If we have a group \(G\) and a subgroup \(H \leq G\). We want to put a group structure on the set of left \(H\)-cosets, \(G / H\) such that \(\pi \ : \ G \rightarrow G / H\) is a homomorphism? This is called the “Quotient Group”. Also if we make that happen and \(\pi\) is a homomorphism. What would the kernel of \(\pi\) be? By definition: $$ \begin{align*} ker(\pi) &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ \pi(g) = e_{G/H}\} \\ &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = e_{G/H}\} \quad \text{(By def, $\pi(a) = aH$)} \\ &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = \pi(e_G)\} \quad \text{($\pi$ is a homomorphism so $\pi(e_G) = e_{G/H}$)} \\ &amp;= \{g \in G \ | \ gH = eH\} \quad \text{(by def of $\pi$ again)} \\ &amp;= H. \end{align*} $$ But we also know that kernels are normal subgroups so this means that \(H\) must be a normal subgroup. So if we make \(\pi\) a homomorphism, then we’ll see that \(H\) is actually a normal subgroup. [Is this right?] Quotient Group Now suppose we have a group \(G\) and a normal subgroup \(N\). Define \(G/N\) to be the set of all left cosets of \(N\) so \(G/N = \{ aN \ | \ a \in G \}\). In fact since \(N\) is normal, the left cosets are the right cosets so we don’t need to say left or right in the definition. Let’s also define a group operation on the group \(G/N\). Definition Let \(G\) be a group and let \(N\) be a normal subgroup. Define the operation on \(G/N\) by $$ \begin{align*} aN \cdot bN = (ab)N \end{align*} $$ The goal is to show that \((G / N, \cdot)\) is a group. But first we need to show that the operation we defined is well-defined (We also want to show that this operation is a homomorphism later). So we need to show that if \(aN = a'N\) and \(bN = b'N\), then \((ab)N = (a'b')N\). Proof (well-defined) Since \(aN = a'N\), then \(a'\) is in the coset \(aN\) and we can write \(a' = an_1\) for some \(n_1 \in N\). Similarly, \(bN = b'N\) so we can write \(b' = bn_2\) for some \(n_2 \in N\). We want to show that \(a'b' = abn\) for some \(n \in N\). Now, $$ \begin{align*} a'b' &amp;= an_1bn_2 \\ &amp;= a(bb^{-1})n_1bn_2 \\ &amp;= (ab)(b^{-1}n_1bn_2) \end{align*} $$ So now we want to show that \(b^{-1}n_1bn_2 \in N\). We know that \(N\) is a normal subgroup. So if we conjugate \(n\) by \(b^{-1}\), then we know that \(b^{-1}nb \in N\) because \(N\) is normal. Moreover, \((b^{-1}nb)(n_2) \in N\) since \(N\) is a subgroup. \(\ \blacksquare\) Proof (\((G/N, \cdot)\) is a group) To show this, we need to verify the group properties Associative: We want to show that \((aN \cdot bN) \cdot cN = aN \cdot (bN \cdot cN)\) $$ \begin{align*} (aN \cdot bN) \cdot cN &amp;= abN \cdot cN \\ &amp;= (ab)cN \\ &amp;= a(bc)N \quad \text{(multiplication is associative)} \\ &amp;= aN \cdot (bN \cdot cN). \end{align*} $$ Identity: The identity element is \((eN)\) Inverses: We want to show that \((aN)^{-1}\) is an inverse of \(aN\). Therefore, \((G/N, \cdot)\) is a group. Proof (homomorphism) Next we want to show that \(\pi: G \rightarrow G/N\) is a homomorphism with kernel \(ker(\pi) = N\). Recall that \(\pi(a) = aN\). Example 1 Let \(G = D_4 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j\}\). We established the identities \(r^4 = e = j^2\) and \(jr = r^{-1}j\). We first claim that \(N = \langle r^2 \rangle = \{e, r^2\}\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\). Why? For any \(g \in D_4\), we have \(g r^2 g^{-1} \in \langle r^2 \rangle\). Since \(N\) is normal, then we can form the quotient group \(G / N\) where $$ \begin{align*} G/N = D_4/N = \{eN, rN, jN, rjN\}. \end{align*} $$ Note that the other possibilities end up being the same as one of the four cosets above. For example \(r^2N = eN\) and \(r^3N = rN\). Note also that this matches Lagrange’s Theorem. By Lagrange, we expect to have \(|G|/|N|\) cosets. \(|G| = 8\) and \(|N| = 2\) so we indeed have 4 elements. Since \(D_4/N\) has 4 elements, then we expect this group to be isomorphic to either the cyclic group of order 4 or the non-cyclic one. How do we know? We can calculate the order of the elements in the group. If there is an element of order 4, then it’s cyclic. If there is not, then it can’t be cyclic. For example \((rN)^2 = r^2N = eN\). Why? \(r^2N\) is the coset $$ \begin{align*} \{r^2(e), r^2(r^2)\} = \{r^2, e\} = eN. \end{align*} $$ What about \((jN)^2\)? $$ \begin{align*} (jN)^2=j^2N = eN. \end{align*} $$ Next, \((rjN)^2 = (rj)^2N\) But \(rj\) is a flip so it’s square is \(e\) and so \((rjN)^2 = eN\). So every element’s square is the identity and no element has order 4. So it’s isomorphic to \(V\). Example 2 Now consider \(D_6 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j, r^5j\}\). Consider \(N = \langle r^3 \rangle = \{e, r^3\}\) which is a normal subgroup of \(D_6\). Why is it normal? Because if we conjugate it with any element from \(D_6\), we will get the same set $$ \begin{align*} r^k r^3 r^{-k} &amp;= r^3 \\ rj r^3 (rj)^{-1} &amp;= jr^{-1} r^3 r j^{-1} = r^3 \\ .... \end{align*} $$ This is actually because \(r^3g = gr^3\) for all \(g \in G\). This is a property of \(r^3\). (in this case \(r^3\) is called “central”). Moreover, \(G/N\) will have \(|G|/|H| = 6\) cosets. $$ \begin{align*} G/N = D_6 / \langle r^3 \rangle = \{eN, rN, r^2N, jN, rjN, r^2jN\} \end{align*} $$ As a reminder, because \(N\) is a normal subgroup, \(G/N\) is a group. It’s a group of order 6. There are two groups of order 6. The abelian cyclic one and \(D_3\) which is isomorphic to \(S_3\). To determine which one, we need to find the order of the elements. Any flip will have order two and so it turns out that \(jN, rjN, r^2jN\) all have order 2. \(eN\) has order 1. For the rest $$ \begin{align*} (rN)^3 = r^3N = \{(r^3)e, (r^3)r^3\} = \{e, r^3\} = eN. \end{align*} $$ In fact, \(r^2N\) has order 3 as well. So none of the elements have order 6 and so this group is not cyclic. It is in fact isomorphic to \(D_3\). Example 3 Now consider \(G = (\mathbf{R}, +)\) and \(H = (\mathbf{Z}, +)\). \(G\) is abelian. Therefore, all of its subgroups are normal and \(H\) is normal. Now let’s form the quotient group as follows $$ \begin{align*} G/H = \mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z} = \{a + \mathbf{Z} \ | \ a \in \mathbf{R}\}. \end{align*} $$ \(a + \mathbf{Z} = [a] = \{a + n \ | \ n \in \mathbf{Z}\}\) is a \(\mathbf{Z}\) coset of \(a\). For example if \(a = \frac{1}{3}\), then $$ \begin{align*} \frac{1}{3} + \mathbf{Z} = \{...,-1 + \frac{1}{3}, 0 + \frac{1}{3}, 1 + \frac{1}{3}, ...\} \subseteq \mathbf{R} \end{align*} $$ \(G/H\) is a group under addition where \([a] + [b] = [a + b]\). This group is abelian. What is this group isomorphic to? Let \(T\) be the set of rotations around the \(z\) axis so \(T = \{r_{\theta} = Rot_{e_3}(\theta) \ | \ \theta \in \mathbf{R}\}\). This is a subgroup of \(SO(3)\). Note here that \(r_{\theta + 2\pi n} = r_{\theta}\). It turns out that \(\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}\) is isomorphic to \(T\). The isomorphism is $$ \begin{align*} \mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z} &amp;\rightarrow T \\ [x] &amp;\rightarrow r_{2\pi x} \end{align*} $$ Example 4 Let \(F\) be a field. (\(F = \mathbf{R}\) or \(\mathbf{C}\) or \(\mathbf{Z}p\), \(p\) is prime). Now let $$ \begin{align*} GL_n(F) = \{ A \in Mat_{n \times n}(F) \ | \ A^{-1} \text{ exists }\} \end{align*} $$ where the product is matrix multiplication. A normal subgroup here is $$ \begin{align*} H = \{cI, c \in F^{x}\} \quad \text{ (where } F^{x} = F - \{0\}). \end{align*} $$ Why is this a normal subgroup? because you can pull out scalars in matrix multiplication so \(A^{-1}cA = cA^{-1}A = cI\). We can form the quotient group $$ \begin{align*} GL_{n}(F) / H = PGL_n(F) \quad \quad \text{ (The Projective Linear Group) } \end{align*} $$ Symmetric Groups We want to know what the normal subgroups of symmetric groups are. In order to do so, we want to see what happens if we conjugate a permutation \(\tau\) with element so \(\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}\)? In turns out in symmetric groups, there is a way to understand conjugation. We actually have a formula. This formula is called the cycle conjugation formula. Given \(\tau = (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... a_k) \in S_n\) where \(\tau\) is a permutation consisting of a \(k-\)cycle with \(a_1,a_2... \in \{1,2,....,n\}\). Then $$ \begin{align*} \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} &amp;= (b_1 \ b_2 \ ... b_k) \quad \text{where } b_i = \sigma(a_i) \\ &amp;= (\sigma(a_1) \ \sigma(a_2) \ ...\ \sigma(a_k)) \end{align*} $$ So we actually get another \(k\) cycle. Proof We want to show that \(\sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} = (\sigma(a_1) \ \sigma(a_2) \ ... \ \sigma(a_k))\). We will compute the new permutation directly. Let \(x \in \{1,2,...,n\}\). It turns out that there are two cases. Case 1: \(x = \sigma(a_i)\): So now we’ll apply the permutation on \(x\). First we apply \(\sigma^{-1}\) but since \(x = \sigma(a_i)\), then we will just get \(a_i\). Next, we’ll apply the cycle and here we’ll get \(a_{i+1}\) since it’s a cycle. Lastly, we need to apply \(\sigma\). So we get \(\sigma(a_{i+1})\). (There is a subtlety here because \(a_{i+1}\) for \(i = k\), is \(i = 1\). To fix this, we’ll let \(a_{k+1} = 1\) or just have two cases). So in summary: $$ \begin{align*} \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} (x) &amp;= \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) \sigma^{-1} (\sigma(a_i)) \\ &amp;= \sigma (a_1 \ a_2 \ ... \ a_k) (a_i) \\ &amp;= \begin{cases} a_{j+1} \quad &amp;\text{if } j \neq k \\ a_1 \quad \quad &amp;\text{if } j = k\end{cases}]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lecture 14: Lagrange’s Theorem, Order Theorem &amp;amp; Equivalence Relations</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/06/math417-14-lagrange-order-equivalence.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lecture 14: Lagrange’s Theorem, Order Theorem &amp;amp; Equivalence Relations" /><published>2025-02-06T00:01:36-08:00</published><updated>2025-02-06T00:01:36-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/06/math417-14-lagrange-order-equivalence</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/06/math417-14-lagrange-order-equivalence.html"><![CDATA[<p>Last time, we studied <b>Lagrange’s Theorem</b> which stated that given a finite group \(G\) and a subgroup \(H\) of \(G\), then \(|H|\) divides \(|G|\). Moreover, \(|H| / |G|\) is the number of \(H-\) left cosets in \(G\). In fact, this number was defined to be the index of a group \([G : H]\). So</p>

$$
\begin{align*}
[G : H] = \frac{|H|}{|G|}.

$$
</div>
<p>As a consequence, this led to the <b>Order Theorem</b> which stated that if \(G\) was a finite group, then for any \(g \in G\), \(o(g)\) divides \(|G|\). 
<br />
<br />
But now as we see, both theorems are stated for finite groups \(G\) and we know from last lecture that the index of a group can be still defined even if \(G\) is infinite. So this led to the generalized version of Lagrange Theorem as follows:
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br /></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Generalized Lagrange Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G \geq H \geq K\). Then for any \([G: K] = [G : H] [H : K]\).

Note here that if \(K\) is the trivial subgroup so \(K = \{e\}\), then \([H:\{e\}] = |H|\). The cosets of the trivial subgroups have size 1 so we’re dividing \(H\) isto subsets of size 1 and therefore we get back the earlier Lagrange’s Theorem
<br />
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Suppose we have \(\mathbf{Z} \geq \mathbf{Z_3} \geq \mathbf{Z}_{12}\) where \(G = \mathbf{Z}\), \(H = \mathbf{Z}_{3}\) and \(K = \mathbf{Z}_{12}\). We know that \([\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}] = 12\) and \([\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{3}] = 3\) so</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
[\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}] = [\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{3}]  [\mathbf{Z}_{3} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}] \\
12 = 3[\mathbf{Z}_{3} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}]
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>From this we can deduce that the index of \(\mathbf{Z}_{12}\) inside \(\mathbf{Z}_3\) is 4.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Proof of Generalized Lagrange</b></h4>
<p>\([H: K]\) is the number of left \(K\)-cosets inside \(H\). So \(aK \subseteq H\). Observe that for any \(aH\), the number of left \(K\)-cosets in \(aH\) is equal to \([H : K]\). Consider the bijection</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
H &amp;\rightarrow aH \\
h &amp;\rightarrow ah
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Then \(hk\) under this bijection will be \(ahK\). 
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<p>Let \(D_4 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j\}\). Consider:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
H &amp;= \langle r^2, j \rangle = \{e, r^2, j, r^2j\} \\
K &amp;= \langle r^2 \rangle = \{e, r^2\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Then the index \([G : H] = \frac{|H|}{|G|} = 2\) which is the number of \(H\)-left cosets in \(G\). Similarly, \([H : K] = 2\) which is the number of \(K-\) left cosets in \(H\). For example</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
eH &amp;= \{e, r^2, j, r^2j\} \ | \ eK = \{e, r^2\}, \ jK = \{j, r^2j\} \\
rH &amp;= \{r, r^3, rj, r^3j\} \ | \ rK = \{r, r^3\}, \ rjK = \{rj, r^3\}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>If you look at \(eH\), observe that it contains both \(K\)-cosets and if you look at \(rH\), you’ll see that it also contains both of the \(K\) cosets.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Order Theorem</b></h4>
<p>Back to the Order Theorem. For example, for \(|G| = 12\), the order of the elements inside \(G\) are \(o(g) \in \{1,2,3,4,6,12\}\). The question is do we know if there must be a subgroup of order 6? 4? what about 2? For 2, if the order of the group is even, then we must have an element with order 2. To see why, we have the Even Order Theorem as follows:
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br /></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Even Order Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
If \(|G| = n\) and \(n\) is even, then there exists a \(g \in G\) with \(o(g) = 2\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Observe that if \(a \in G\), then \(a^2 = 2\) if and only if \(a^{-1} = a\). In this case, the order must either be 1 or 2 so \(o(a) \in \{1,2\}\). Now, let \(a \in G\). For each \(a\), produce a subset \(C\) such that \(C = \{a, a^{-1}\}\). This is a subset of \(G\) of order 1 or 2 depending on whether \(a = a^{-1}\). 
<br />
<br />
Claim: For \(\{a, a^{-1}\}\) and \(C' = \{b, b^{-1}\}\). Either \(C = C'\) or \(C \cap C' = \emptyset\). Moreover</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\bigcup_{a \in G} \{a, a^{-1}\} = G.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>The union of all these subsets is \(G\). So we get a partition of the set \(G\) into pairwise disjoint subsets of size 1 or 2. So \(n = |G| = r + 2s\). where \(r\) is the number of subsets \(\{a, a^{-1}\}\) of size 1 and \(s\) is the number of subsets \(\{a, a^{-1}\}\) of size \(2\). Notice here that \(r\) is counting all the elements such that each element is its own inverse. So \(r = |\{a \in G \ | \ a^2 = e\}|\). In fact, \(r\) is the number of elements in \(G\) of order 1 or 2. 
<br />
<br />
So we showed that \(n = |G| = r + 2s\) but by assumption, \(n\) is even and since it’s even then 2 divides \(n\). So 2 must divide \(r + 2s\). Therefore, \(2\) must divide \(r\). So \(r\) is even. We also know that \(r\) is at least 1 because the identity element has order 1. Therefore, there must exist at least another element whose order is 2. So there exists a \(g \in G\) such that \(o(g) = 2\). \(\ \blacksquare\).
<br />
<br />
There is a generalization of this theorem that we’ll prove later. But if \(p\) is prime and it divides \(|G|\), then there exists an element of order \(p\).
<br />

<h4><b>Equivalence Relations</b></h4>
<p>Review of equivalence relations</p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
A relation on a set \(X\) is a subset \(R \subseteq X \times X\). We write \(a \sim b\) for \((a,b) \in R\).
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
For example, let \(X = \mathbf{Z}\), then examples of relations are \(=, &gt;, \geq, \leq, &lt; ...\), “coprime”, \(\equiv \bmod n\) and so on.
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
A equivalence relation \(\sim\) on \(X\) is one such that
<ol>
	<li>Reflexive: \(a \sim a \ \forall a \in X\).</li>
	<li>Symmetric: \(a \sim b \implies b \sim a \ \forall a, b \in X\).</li>
	<li>Transitive: \(a \sim b, b \sim c \implies a \sim c \ \forall a, b, c \in X\).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><br />
Given a set \(X\) with an equivalence relation \(\sim\), we have an equivalence class which is a subset of \(X\) of the form</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
[a] = \{b \in X \ | \ a \sim b\} \quad \text{ for some } a \in X
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Fact: Either \([a] = [b]\) or \([a] \cap [b] = \emptyset\) so \([a] = [b] \implies a \sim b\). 
<br />
<br />
So this equivalence relations gives us a way to partition a given set \(X\) into pairwise disjoint nonempty subsets. In fact we have a bijection between the equivalence relation on \(X\) and the partitions of \(X\). What does this mean? It means that we can go either direction, if we have an equivalence relation, we can get a partition of \(X\) into subsets. And if we have a set of disjoint subsets that partitions \(X\), then we can get an equivalence relation from that. How? any two elements will be in the same equivalence class if they’re in the same subset. So we’re kind of talking about the same thing here. 
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
So now let \((X, \sim)\) be a set with equivalence relation. Define \(Y\) as the set of equivalence classes of \(\sim\). We sometimes denotes \(Y\) with \(X / \sim\) “quotient set of equivalence relation”. Define</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi \ : \ &amp;X \rightarrow \\
     &amp;\pi(a) = [a]
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>\(\pi\) is quotient function. \(\pi\) is surjective. Every equivalence class, has an element \(a\) that is in the set \(X\) by definition. So now given \(\pi\), we can recover the equivalence relation.

We know that \([\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}] = 12\) and \([\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{3}] = 3\) so $$ \begin{align*} [\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}] = [\mathbf{Z} : \mathbf{Z}_{3}] [\mathbf{Z}_{3} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}] \\ 12 = 3[\mathbf{Z}_{3} : \mathbf{Z}_{12}] \end{align*} $$ From this we can deduce that the index of \(\mathbf{Z}_{12}\) inside \(\mathbf{Z}_3\) is 4. Proof of Generalized Lagrange \([H: K]\) is the number of left \(K\)-cosets inside \(H\). So \(aK \subseteq H\). Observe that for any \(aH\), the number of left \(K\)-cosets in \(aH\) is equal to \([H : K]\). Consider the bijection $$ \begin{align*} H &amp;\rightarrow aH \\ h &amp;\rightarrow ah \end{align*} $$ Then \(hk\) under this bijection will be \(ahK\). Example Let \(D_4 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j\}\). Consider: $$ \begin{align*} H &amp;= \langle r^2, j \rangle = \{e, r^2, j, r^2j\} \\ K &amp;= \langle r^2 \rangle = \{e, r^2\} \end{align*} $$ Then the index \([G : H] = \frac{|H|}{|G|} = 2\) which is the number of \(H\)-left cosets in \(G\). Similarly, \([H : K] = 2\) which is the number of \(K-\) left cosets in \(H\). For example $$ \begin{align*} eH &amp;= \{e, r^2, j, r^2j\} \ | \ eK = \{e, r^2\}, \ jK = \{j, r^2j\} \\ rH &amp;= \{r, r^3, rj, r^3j\} \ | \ rK = \{r, r^3\}, \ rjK = \{rj, r^3\}. \end{align*} $$ If you look at \(eH\), observe that it contains both \(K\)-cosets and if you look at \(rH\), you’ll see that it also contains both of the \(K\) cosets. Order Theorem Back to the Order Theorem. For example, for \(|G| = 12\), the order of the elements inside \(G\) are \(o(g) \in \{1,2,3,4,6,12\}\). The question is do we know if there must be a subgroup of order 6? 4? what about 2? For 2, if the order of the group is even, then we must have an element with order 2. To see why, we have the Even Order Theorem as follows: Even Order Theorem If \(|G| = n\) and \(n\) is even, then there exists a \(g \in G\) with \(o(g) = 2\). Proof Observe that if \(a \in G\), then \(a^2 = 2\) if and only if \(a^{-1} = a\). In this case, the order must either be 1 or 2 so \(o(a) \in \{1,2\}\). Now, let \(a \in G\). For each \(a\), produce a subset \(C\) such that \(C = \{a, a^{-1}\}\). This is a subset of \(G\) of order 1 or 2 depending on whether \(a = a^{-1}\). Claim: For \(\{a, a^{-1}\}\) and \(C' = \{b, b^{-1}\}\). Either \(C = C'\) or \(C \cap C' = \emptyset\). Moreover $$ \begin{align*} \bigcup_{a \in G} \{a, a^{-1}\} = G. \end{align*} $$ The union of all these subsets is \(G\). So we get a partition of the set \(G\) into pairwise disjoint subsets of size 1 or 2. So \(n = |G| = r + 2s\). where \(r\) is the number of subsets \(\{a, a^{-1}\}\) of size 1 and \(s\) is the number of subsets \(\{a, a^{-1}\}\) of size \(2\). Notice here that \(r\) is counting all the elements such that each element is its own inverse. So \(r = |\{a \in G \ | \ a^2 = e\}|\). In fact, \(r\) is the number of elements in \(G\) of order 1 or 2. So we showed that \(n = |G| = r + 2s\) but by assumption, \(n\) is even and since it’s even then 2 divides \(n\). So 2 must divide \(r + 2s\). Therefore, \(2\) must divide \(r\). So \(r\) is even. We also know that \(r\) is at least 1 because the identity element has order 1. Therefore, there must exist at least another element whose order is 2. So there exists a \(g \in G\) such that \(o(g) = 2\). \(\ \blacksquare\). There is a generalization of this theorem that we’ll prove later. But if \(p\) is prime and it divides \(|G|\), then there exists an element of order \(p\). Equivalence Relations Review of equivalence relations Definition A relation on a set \(X\) is a subset \(R \subseteq X \times X\). We write \(a \sim b\) for \((a,b) \in R\). For example, let \(X = \mathbf{Z}\), then examples of relations are \(=, &gt;, \geq, \leq, &lt; ...\), “coprime”, \(\equiv \bmod n\) and so on. Definition A equivalence relation \(\sim\) on \(X\) is one such that Reflexive: \(a \sim a \ \forall a \in X\). Symmetric: \(a \sim b \implies b \sim a \ \forall a, b \in X\). Transitive: \(a \sim b, b \sim c \implies a \sim c \ \forall a, b, c \in X\). Given a set \(X\) with an equivalence relation \(\sim\), we have an equivalence class which is a subset of \(X\) of the form $$ \begin{align*} [a] = \{b \in X \ | \ a \sim b\} \quad \text{ for some } a \in X \end{align*} $$ Fact: Either \([a] = [b]\) or \([a] \cap [b] = \emptyset\) so \([a] = [b] \implies a \sim b\). So this equivalence relations gives us a way to partition a given set \(X\) into pairwise disjoint nonempty subsets. In fact we have a bijection between the equivalence relation on \(X\) and the partitions of \(X\). What does this mean? It means that we can go either direction, if we have an equivalence relation, we can get a partition of \(X\) into subsets. And if we have a set of disjoint subsets that partitions \(X\), then we can get an equivalence relation from that. How? any two elements will be in the same equivalence class if they’re in the same subset. So we’re kind of talking about the same thing here. So now let \((X, \sim)\) be a set with equivalence relation. Define \(Y\) as the set of equivalence classes of \(\sim\). We sometimes denotes \(Y\) with \(X / \sim\) “quotient set of equivalence relation”. Define $$ \begin{align*} \pi \ : \ &amp;X \rightarrow \\ &amp;\pi(a) = [a] \end{align*} $$ \(\pi\) is quotient function. \(\pi\) is surjective. Every equivalence class, has an element \(a\) that is in the set \(X\) by definition. So now given \(\pi\), we can recover the equivalence relation.

Definition 2.4.14
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
Let \(H\) be subgroup of a group \(G\). <br />
\(gH = \{gh \ | \ h \in H\}\) is called a left coset of \(H\) in \(G\). 
<br />
\(Hg = \{hg \ | \ h \in H\}\) is called a right coset of \(H\) in \(G\).
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>Example 1: Let \(D_4 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j\}\). where \(r^4 = e = j^2\) and \(jr = r^{-1}j\).
<br /> Define the subgroup \(H = \langle j \rangle = \{e, j\}\). The left cosets are:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
eH &amp;= \{e, j\} = jH \\
rH &amp;= \{r, rj\} = rjH \\
r^2H &amp;= \{r^2, r^2j\} = r^2jH \\
r^3H &amp;= \{r^3, r^3j\} = r^3jH \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Notice here that none of the elements overlap between the sets so this gives us a way to partition the set \(G\) into four pairwise disjoint subsets (We’ll prove this next). The right cosets are</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
He &amp;= \{e, j\} = Hj \\
Hr &amp;= \{r, jr\} = \{e, r^3j\} = Hr^3j \\
Hr^2 &amp;= \{r^2, r^2j\} = Hr^2j \\
Hr^3 &amp;= \{r^3, rj\} = Hrj \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Example 2: Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) (with addition) and take \(H = \mathbf{Z}n \leq G\) where \(n \geq 1\). <br />
The left coset is \(a + H = a + \mathbf{Z}n = \{a + kn \ | \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}\) <br />
The left coset is \(H + a = \mathbf{Z}n + a\) which is the same as the right coset. This happens because the group is abelian!<br />
Another name for these cosets are the congruence class \([a]_n\). 
<br />

<h4><b>Cosets are Pairwise Disjoint</b></h4>
<p>Next we show why these subets must be pairwise disjoint.
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition (2.5.4)
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). If \(X, Y \subseteq G\) are left \(H-\)cosets, then either
<ol>
	<li>\(X \cap Y = \emptyset\).</li>
	<li>\(X = Y\).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We’ll prove that not (1) implies (2) (to prove an or statement). <br />
Suppose that \(g \in X \cap Y\). We want to show that \(X = Y\). Since \(X\) and \(Y\) are left cosets, then we can write \(X = xH\) and \(Y = yH\) for some \(x, y \in G\). Since \(g \in X \cap Y\), then we can write \(g = xh_1 = yh_2\) for some \(h_1, h_2 \in H\). Observe now that</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
x &amp;= gh_1^{-1} \\
  &amp;= (yh_2)h_1^{-1} \\
  &amp;= y(h_2h_1^{-1})
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Likewise</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
y &amp;= gh_2^{-1} \\
  &amp;= (xh_1)h_2^{-1} \\
  &amp;= x(h_1h_2^{-1})
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Now, let \(xh \in xH\), then</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
xh &amp;= (yh_2h_1^{-1})h \\
   &amp;= y(h_2h_1^{-1}h)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>But this implies that \(xh \in yH\). So \(xH \subseteq yH\). Likewise, let \(yh \in yH\), then</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
yh &amp;= (xh_1h_2^{-1})h \\
   &amp;= x(h_1h_2^{-1}h)
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>so \(yh \in xH\) and \(yH \subseteq xH\). Therefore \(xH = yH\). \(\blacksquare\) 
<br />
<br />
Based on this, we have the following proposition

<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition 2.5.3
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\), and let \(a\) and \(b\) be
elements of \(G\). The following conditions are equivalent:
<ol type="a">
	<li>\(a \in bH\).</li>
	<li>\(b \in aH\).</li>
	<li>\(aH = bH\).</li>

</ol>
</div>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><br />
<b>Proof (book)</b>
<br />
Suppose \((a)\) holds. Let \(a \in bH\). Then we can write \(a = bh\). Since \(H\) is a subgroup, then we know \(h^{-1} \in H\). So we can write \(b = ah^{-1}\). But \(ah^{-1}\) is in \(aH\) by the definition of a left coset which is what we wanted to show. With similar reason \((b)\) also implies \((a)\). 
<br />
<br />
For \((c)\), we want to show that \(aH \subseteq bH\) and \(bH \subseteq aH\). To show that \(bH \subseteq aH\), we want to show that for any arbitrary element \(x\) in \(bH\), that \(x\) is also in \(aH\). So consider any \(x \in bH\). By the definition of a coset, we can write \(x = bh\) for some \(h \in H\). Now suppose that \((b)\) holds and so we have \(b \in aH\). This means that we can write \(b = ah_1\) for some \(h_1 \in H\). But this means that we can write \(x = bh = ah_1h\). The product \(h_1h\) is in \(H\) because \(H\) is a subgroup. Furthermore, \(ah_1h\) must be in \(aH\) by the definition of a coset. Therefore, \(x = bh \in aH\) and so \(bH \subseteq aH\) as we wanted to show. Since \((b)\) also implies \((a)\) we can use a similar reasoning to show that \(aH \subseteq bH\).

<h4><b>Lagrange Theorem</b></h4>
<p>Based on what we learned so far, we can now present the following important results
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). Then all left \(H-\)cosets and right \(H-\)cosets have the same cardinality as \(H\).
</div>
<p><br />
This works well for infinite groups as well because all we need is a bijection to show they have the same cardinality.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We know the coset \(aH\) is constructed such that each element is appended on the left by \(a\). So naturally construct the following bijection</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
H &amp;\rightarrow aH \\
h &amp;\rightarrow ah
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This works. For any element in \(x \in aH\), the inverse is just \(a^{-1}x\). Likewise we can construct a bijection for the right coset as follows</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
H &amp;\rightarrow Ha \\
h &amp;\rightarrow ha
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br />
This leads to Lagrange Theorem.
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="yellowheaderdiv">
Lagrange Theorem
</div>
<div class="yellowbodydiv">
Let \(G\) be a finite group and let \(H\) be a subgroup of \(G\). Then \(|H|\) divides \(|G|\) and \(|G| / |H| = \) the number of left cosets of \(H\) in \(G =\) the number of right cosets of \(H\) in \(G\).
</div>
<p><br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We know by the previous proposition that all cosets have the same cardinality as \(H\) itself. Moreover, we know that the collection of left cosets \(\{aH, a \in G\}\) partitions \(G\) into pairwise disjoint subsets. Therefore</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
|G| &amp;= \sum|aH| \\
    &amp;= \sum |H| \quad \text{(by the previous proposition)}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>From this we see that \(|G| = m|H|\) as we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\)

<br />
This in turn leads to the following theorem:

<h4><b>More Definitions in Cosets</b></h4>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
	The index of a subgroup \(H \leq G\) is the number of left \(H-\)cosets.
	We denote the index by \([G:H]\) which is index of \(H\) in \(G\).
</div>
<p><br />
The index could be infinite but we only care when the index is finite. 
<br />
Using Lagrange’s Theorem also note that if \(G\) is finite, then \([G : H] = \frac{|G|}{|H|}\). 
<br />
Also note that \([G:H]\) can be finite even if \(G\) and \(H\) are infinte.
<br />
<br />
Example: Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}, H = \mathbf{Z_n}\) where \(n &gt; 0\). Then the index of \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) inside \(\mathbf{Z}\) is the number of left cosets which is the number of congruent classes, \([\mathbf{Z}:\mathbf{Z}_n] = n\)
<br />
<br />
We might ask why is the definition is in terms of the number of left cosets and not the right cosets. The answer is in the next proposition
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). There is a bijection between the collection of left cosets and the collection of right cosets.
$$
\begin{align*}
\{aH, a \in G\} \rightarrow \{Ha, a \in G\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p><br />
The actual bijection is to take all the elements in the left cosets, take their inverses. The collection of inverses will be the elements in the right cosets. Why is this true?
<br />
If \(X = aH = \{aH \ | \ h \in H\}\), then \(X^{-1} = \{ (ah)^{-1} \ | \ h \in H \} = Ha^{-1}\).
<br />
<br />
So why not use \(aH \rightarrow Ha\)? This might not be defined.

Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). The following are equivalent
<ol>
	<li>\(H\) is a normal subgroup.</li>
	<li>Left \(H\)-cosets are the same as right \(H\)-cosets.</li>
	<li>Every left \(H\)-coset is contained in a right \(H\)-coset.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
\((3) \rightarrow (1)\):<br />
Suppose every left \(H\)-coset is a subset of some right \(H\)-coset. Let \(a \in G\). We want to show that \(H\) is a normal subgroup. So we want to show that \(aHa^{-1} \subseteq H\). Given that every left coset in contained in a right coset, consider the left coset \(aH\). This coset is contained in some right coset. Since \(a \in aH\), then \(a\) must be in the right coset as well. We can claim that \(aH \subseteq Ha\). So for any \(h \in H\), \(ah = h'a\) for some \(h' \in H\). Observe that \(aha^{-1} = h'\) for some \(h' \in H\). In other words, \(aHa^{-1} \in H\) and \(H\) is normal. \(\ \blacksquare\)

<h4><b>Applications</b></h4>
<p>Let’s look at some applications of the order theorem.
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition

<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(|G| = p\) where \(p\) is prime, then \(G\) is cyclic.
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Let \(g \in G\). By the order theorem, the order of \(g\) must divide \(|G|\) which is a prime number. So \(o(g) \in \{1, p\}\). \(\{e\}\) is the only group with order 1 and \(|G| = p &gt; 1\) so we must have an element \(g \in G\) such that \(g \neq e\). So \(o(g) = p\). But we also said that the order of an element is also the size of the cyclic group generated by \(g\) so \(|\langle g \rangle| = p\). Therefore, we must have \(G = \langle g \rangle\). \(\ \blacksquare\)

If \(|G| = 4\), then \(G\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_4\) or \(V\) the symmetries of the rectangle.
</div>

<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Let \(g \in G\). The order of \(g\) has to divide 4 by the order theorem so \(o(g) \in \{1,2,4\}\). If \(o(g) = 4\), then \(o(g) = 4\) and \(\langle g \rangle = G\) so \(G\) is cyclic and so it is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_4\). If \(o(g) \neq 4\). Then \(G\) must have 4 distinct elements so \(G = \{a, b, c, d\}\)  none of the elements can have order 4. \(a, b, c\) can’t have order 1. So they must be of order 2 and their squares must be the identity. This gives us enough information fill out the multiplication table of this group as follows:</p>

<h4><b>Subgroups of \(D_5\)</b></h4>
<p>Let’s use Lagrange’s Theorem next. Specifically, let’s analyze the subgroups of the dihedral group \(D_5\). First,</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
D_5 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4,j\}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>The first we want to do when finding its subgroups is find the order of each element in \(D_5\). We know \(|D_5| = 10\) so the orders of the elements must divide 10. We also know that each flip’s order is 2 (because we established previously that \(j^2 = e\)). We also established previously that \(r^5 = e\). The rest of the elements must have their order \(\in \{1,2,5,10\}\) by the Order Theorem. In fact</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Order 1: }&amp;: e. \\
\text{Order 2: }&amp;: j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j. \\
\text{Order 5: }&amp;: r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Now, any subgroup of \(G\) must have order dividing the order of \(G\) so they must divide 10 by Lagrange’s Theorem. So \(|H| \in \{1,2,5,10\}\). Note here that 2 and 5 are prime! so by the previous proposition, they must be cyclic. We list the subgroups as follows by their orders:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Order 1: }&amp;: \{e\}. \\
\text{Order 2: }&amp;: \langle j \rangle , \langle rj \rangle , \langle r^2j\rangle , \langle r^3j\rangle , \langle r^4j\rangle . \\
\text{Order 5: }&amp;: \langle r \rangle. \\
\text{Order 10: }&amp;: D_5. \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>We can draw the subgroups as follows</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec13-cosets/d5.png" width="77%" class="center" /></p>

<p>First, let’s find the order of each element knowing that the order of each flip is 2 and know that element must have an order that divides 18. [Side note from studying. Note that \(\langle r \rangle\) is a cyclic subgroup of order 9 and it has the elements \(r, r^2, r^3, ..., r^8\). Each element inside the subgroup must have order \(n / gcd(n,power)\) where n is the order of \(r\). So the order of \(r^3\) is \(9/gcd(9,3) = 3\). Remember that the order of an element depends on the operation of the group and it is the least power \(k\) such that \(g^k = e\).]</p>

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Order 1: }&amp;: e. \\
\text{Order 2: }&amp;: j, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j, r^5j, r^6j, r^7j, r^8j. \\

\text{Order 6: }&amp;: \\
\text{Order 9: }&amp;: r, r^2, r^4, r^5, r^7, r^8. \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>For the subgroups, if the order was 2 or 3, then we know they must be cyclic. In this case, we know all the subgroups of order 2 (all the flips) are cyclic unique subgroups. For orders 3 and 6, they could be cyclic but they could also fail to be cyclic. Take order 3, first we check if there are elements of order 3 in the group. Yes, we have \(r^3\) and \(r^6\). Why we look for those? Because by definition of the order of an element, they will each generate a subgroup of order 3 (Recall from the subgroups lecture \(|\langle g \rangle| = o(g)\)). In fact, here \(r^3\) and \(r^6\) both generate the same subgroup.</p>

<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Order 1: }&amp;: \{e\}. \\
\text{Order 2: }&amp;: \langle j\rangle, \langle rj \rangle, \langle r^2j \rangle, \langle r^3j \rangle, \langle r^4j \rangle, \langle r^5j \rangle, \langle r^6j \rangle, \langle r^7j \rangle, \langle r^8j \rangle. \\
\text{Order 3: }&amp;: \langle r^3 \rangle. \\
\text{Order 6: }&amp;: ? \\
\text{Order 18: }&amp;: D_9. \\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>What about order 6? Are there any elements of order 6? No, therefore, there aren’t cyclic groups of order 6. One thing we do know is that any element in that subgroup must have order dividing the order of the subgroup. So any element in it must divide 6 so the choices are \(\{1,2,3,6\}\). Here it’s trial and error. For example guessing \(\langle r^3, j \rangle\), we see that it consists of</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\langle r^3, j \rangle = \{e, r^3, r^6, j, r^3j, r^6j\}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Notice here that \(jr^3 = r^6j\) by the identity \(jr^k = r^{-k}j\). Is there another group of order 6? Instead of \(j\), we can try another element of order 3:</p>
<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
\langle r^3, rj \rangle = \{e, r^3, r^6, rj, r^4j, r^7j\}.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Overall, we’ll have the following subgroups. These lines indicate whether the subgroup is contained in another subgroup so \(\{e\}\) is contained in all of them. \(\langle r^3 \rangle\) is contained in \(\langle r^3, j \rangle\).</p>

Examples Example 1: Let \(D_4 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j\}\). where \(r^4 = e = j^2\) and \(jr = r^{-1}j\). Define the subgroup \(H = \langle j \rangle = \{e, j\}\). The left cosets are: $$ \begin{align*} eH &amp;= \{e, j\} = jH \\ rH &amp;= \{r, rj\} = rjH \\ r^2H &amp;= \{r^2, r^2j\} = r^2jH \\ r^3H &amp;= \{r^3, r^3j\} = r^3jH \\ \end{align*} $$ Notice here that none of the elements overlap between the sets so this gives us a way to partition the set \(G\) into four pairwise disjoint subsets (We’ll prove this next). The right cosets are $$ \begin{align*} He &amp;= \{e, j\} = Hj \\ Hr &amp;= \{r, jr\} = \{e, r^3j\} = Hr^3j \\ Hr^2 &amp;= \{r^2, r^2j\} = Hr^2j \\ Hr^3 &amp;= \{r^3, rj\} = Hrj \\ \end{align*} $$ Example 2: Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}\) (with addition) and take \(H = \mathbf{Z}n \leq G\) where \(n \geq 1\). The left coset is \(a + H = a + \mathbf{Z}n = \{a + kn \ | \ k \in \mathbf{Z}\}\) The left coset is \(H + a = \mathbf{Z}n + a\) which is the same as the right coset. This happens because the group is abelian! Another name for these cosets are the congruence class \([a]_n\). Cosets are Pairwise Disjoint Next we show why these subets must be pairwise disjoint. Proposition (2.5.4) Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). If \(X, Y \subseteq G\) are left \(H-\)cosets, then either \(X \cap Y = \emptyset\). \(X = Y\). Proof We’ll prove that not (1) implies (2) (to prove an or statement). Suppose that \(g \in X \cap Y\). We want to show that \(X = Y\). Since \(X\) and \(Y\) are left cosets, then we can write \(X = xH\) and \(Y = yH\) for some \(x, y \in G\). Since \(g \in X \cap Y\), then we can write \(g = xh_1 = yh_2\) for some \(h_1, h_2 \in H\). Observe now that $$ \begin{align*} x &amp;= gh_1^{-1} \\ &amp;= (yh_2)h_1^{-1} \\ &amp;= y(h_2h_1^{-1}) \end{align*} $$ Likewise $$ \begin{align*} y &amp;= gh_2^{-1} \\ &amp;= (xh_1)h_2^{-1} \\ &amp;= x(h_1h_2^{-1}) \end{align*} $$ Now, let \(xh \in xH\), then $$ \begin{align*} xh &amp;= (yh_2h_1^{-1})h \\ &amp;= y(h_2h_1^{-1}h) \end{align*} $$ But this implies that \(xh \in yH\). So \(xH \subseteq yH\). Likewise, let \(yh \in yH\), then $$ \begin{align*} yh &amp;= (xh_1h_2^{-1})h \\ &amp;= x(h_1h_2^{-1}h) \end{align*} $$ so \(yh \in xH\) and \(yH \subseteq xH\). Therefore \(xH = yH\). \(\blacksquare\) Based on this, we have the following proposition Proposition 2.5.3 Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\), and let \(a\) and \(b\) be elements of \(G\). The following conditions are equivalent: \(a \in bH\). \(b \in aH\). \(aH = bH\). \(b^{-1}a \in H\). \(a^{-1}b \in H\). Proof (book) Suppose \((a)\) holds. Let \(a \in bH\). Then we can write \(a = bh\). Since \(H\) is a subgroup, then we know \(h^{-1} \in H\). So we can write \(b = ah^{-1}\). But \(ah^{-1}\) is in \(aH\) by the definition of a left coset which is what we wanted to show. With similar reason \((b)\) also implies \((a)\). For \((c)\), we want to show that \(aH \subseteq bH\) and \(bH \subseteq aH\). To show that \(bH \subseteq aH\), we want to show that for any arbitrary element \(x\) in \(bH\), that \(x\) is also in \(aH\). So consider any \(x \in bH\). By the definition of a coset, we can write \(x = bh\) for some \(h \in H\). Now suppose that \((b)\) holds and so we have \(b \in aH\). This means that we can write \(b = ah_1\) for some \(h_1 \in H\). But this means that we can write \(x = bh = ah_1h\). The product \(h_1h\) is in \(H\) because \(H\) is a subgroup. Furthermore, \(ah_1h\) must be in \(aH\) by the definition of a coset. Therefore, \(x = bh \in aH\) and so \(bH \subseteq aH\) as we wanted to show. Since \((b)\) also implies \((a)\) we can use a similar reasoning to show that \(aH \subseteq bH\). For \((d)\) …. Lagrange Theorem Based on what we learned so far, we can now present the following important results Proposition Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). Then all left \(H-\)cosets and right \(H-\)cosets have the same cardinality as \(H\). This works well for infinite groups as well because all we need is a bijection to show they have the same cardinality. Proof We know the coset \(aH\) is constructed such that each element is appended on the left by \(a\). So naturally construct the following bijection $$ \begin{align*} H &amp;\rightarrow aH \\ h &amp;\rightarrow ah \end{align*} $$ This works. For any element in \(x \in aH\), the inverse is just \(a^{-1}x\). Likewise we can construct a bijection for the right coset as follows $$ \begin{align*} H &amp;\rightarrow Ha \\ h &amp;\rightarrow ha \end{align*} $$ This leads to Lagrange Theorem. Lagrange Theorem Let \(G\) be a finite group and let \(H\) be a subgroup of \(G\). Then \(|H|\) divides \(|G|\) and \(|G| / |H| = \) the number of left cosets of \(H\) in \(G =\) the number of right cosets of \(H\) in \(G\). Proof We know by the previous proposition that all cosets have the same cardinality as \(H\) itself. Moreover, we know that the collection of left cosets \(\{aH, a \in G\}\) partitions \(G\) into pairwise disjoint subsets. Therefore $$ \begin{align*} |G| &amp;= \sum|aH| \\ &amp;= \sum |H| \quad \text{(by the previous proposition)} \end{align*} $$ From this we see that \(|G| = m|H|\) as we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\) This in turn leads to the following theorem: Order Theorem Let \(G\) be a finite group. Then for any \(g \in G\), \(o(g)\) divides \(|G|\). Proof [TODO] More Definitions in Cosets Definition The index of a subgroup \(H \leq G\) is the number of left \(H-\)cosets. We denote the index by \([G:H]\) which is index of \(H\) in \(G\). The index could be infinite but we only care when the index is finite. Using Lagrange’s Theorem also note that if \(G\) is finite, then \([G : H] = \frac{|G|}{|H|}\). Also note that \([G:H]\) can be finite even if \(G\) and \(H\) are infinte. Example: Let \(G = \mathbf{Z}, H = \mathbf{Z_n}\) where \(n &gt; 0\). Then the index of \(\mathbf{Z}_n\) inside \(\mathbf{Z}\) is the number of left cosets which is the number of congruent classes, \([\mathbf{Z}:\mathbf{Z}_n] = n\) We might ask why is the definition is in terms of the number of left cosets and not the right cosets. The answer is in the next proposition Proposition Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). There is a bijection between the collection of left cosets and the collection of right cosets. $$ \begin{align*} \{aH, a \in G\} \rightarrow \{Ha, a \in G\} \end{align*} $$ The actual bijection is to take all the elements in the left cosets, take their inverses. The collection of inverses will be the elements in the right cosets. Why is this true? If \(X = aH = \{aH \ | \ h \in H\}\), then \(X^{-1} = \{ (ah)^{-1} \ | \ h \in H \} = Ha^{-1}\). So why not use \(aH \rightarrow Ha\)? This might not be defined. Proposition Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). The following are equivalent \(H\) is a normal subgroup. Left \(H\)-cosets are the same as right \(H\)-cosets. Every left \(H\)-coset is contained in a right \(H\)-coset. Proof \((3) \rightarrow (1)\): Suppose every left \(H\)-coset is a subset of some right \(H\)-coset. Let \(a \in G\). We want to show that \(H\) is a normal subgroup. So we want to show that \(aHa^{-1} \subseteq H\). Given that every left coset in contained in a right coset, consider the left coset \(aH\). This coset is contained in some right coset. Since \(a \in aH\), then \(a\) must be in the right coset as well. We can claim that \(aH \subseteq Ha\). So for any \(h \in H\), \(ah = h'a\) for some \(h' \in H\). Observe that \(aha^{-1} = h'\) for some \(h' \in H\). In other words, \(aHa^{-1} \in H\) and \(H\) is normal. \(\ \blacksquare\) Applications Let’s look at some applications of the order theorem. Proposition If \(|G| = p\) where \(p\) is prime, then \(G\) is cyclic. Proof Let \(g \in G\). By the order theorem, the order of \(g\) must divide \(|G|\) which is a prime number. So \(o(g) \in \{1, p\}\). \(\{e\}\) is the only group with order 1 and \(|G| = p &gt; 1\) so we must have an element \(g \in G\) such that \(g \neq e\). So \(o(g) = p\). But we also said that the order of an element is also the size of the cyclic group generated by \(g\) so \(|\langle g \rangle| = p\). Therefore, we must have \(G = \langle g \rangle\). \(\ \blacksquare\) Proposition If \(|G| = 4\), then \(G\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_4\) or \(V\) the symmetries of the rectangle. Proof Let \(g \in G\). The order of \(g\) has to divide 4 by the order theorem so \(o(g) \in \{1,2,4\}\). If \(o(g) = 4\), then \(o(g) = 4\) and \(\langle g \rangle = G\) so \(G\) is cyclic and so it is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_4\). If \(o(g) \neq 4\). Then \(G\) must have 4 distinct elements so \(G = \{a, b, c, d\}\) none of the elements can have order 4. \(a, b, c\) can’t have order 1. So they must be of order 2 and their squares must be the identity. This gives us enough information fill out the multiplication table of this group as follows: \(e\) \(a\) \(b\) \(c\) \(e\) \(e\) \(a\) \(b\) \(c\) \(a\) \(a\) \(e\) \(c\) \(b\) \(b\) \(b\) \(c\) \(e\) \(a\) \(c\) \(c\) \(b\) \(a\) \(e\) Subgroups of \(D_5\) Let’s use Lagrange’s Theorem next. Specifically, let’s analyze the subgroups of the dihedral group \(D_5\). First, $$ \begin{align*} D_5 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4,j\} \end{align*} $$ The first we want to do when finding its subgroups is find the order of each element in \(D_5\). We know \(|D_5| = 10\) so the orders of the elements must divide 10. We also know that each flip’s order is 2 (because we established previously that \(j^2 = e\)). We also established previously that \(r^5 = e\). The rest of the elements must have their order \(\in \{1,2,5,10\}\) by the Order Theorem. In fact $$ \begin{align*} \text{Order 1: }&amp;: e. \\ \text{Order 2: }&amp;: j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j. \\ \text{Order 5: }&amp;: r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5. \end{align*} $$ Now, any subgroup of \(G\) must have order dividing the order of \(G\) so they must divide 10 by Lagrange’s Theorem. So \(|H| \in \{1,2,5,10\}\). Note here that 2 and 5 are prime! so by the previous proposition, they must be cyclic. We list the subgroups as follows by their orders: $$ \begin{align*} \text{Order 1: }&amp;: \{e\}. \\ \text{Order 2: }&amp;: \langle j \rangle , \langle rj \rangle , \langle r^2j\rangle , \langle r^3j\rangle , \langle r^4j\rangle . \\ \text{Order 5: }&amp;: \langle r \rangle. \\ \text{Order 10: }&amp;: D_5. \\ \end{align*} $$ We can draw the subgroups as follows Notice that there is 1 group of order 5 while there are 5 groups of order 2. Subgroups of \(D_9\) We list the elements of \(D_9\) as follows $$ \begin{align*} D_9 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5, r^6, r^7, r^8, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j, r^5j, r^6j, r^7j, r^8j\} \end{align*} $$ First, let’s find the order of each element knowing that the order of each flip is 2 and know that element must have an order that divides 18. [Side note from studying. Note that \(\langle r \rangle\) is a cyclic subgroup of order 9 and it has the elements \(r, r^2, r^3, ..., r^8\). Each element inside the subgroup must have order \(n / gcd(n,power)\) where n is the order of \(r\). So the order of \(r^3\) is \(9/gcd(9,3) = 3\). Remember that the order of an element depends on the operation of the group and it is the least power \(k\) such that \(g^k = e\).] $$ \begin{align*} \text{Order 1: }&amp;: e. \\ \text{Order 2: }&amp;: j, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j, r^4j, r^5j, r^6j, r^7j, r^8j. \\ \text{Order 3: }&amp;: r^3, r^6. \\ \text{Order 6: }&amp;: \\ \text{Order 9: }&amp;: r, r^2, r^4, r^5, r^7, r^8. \\ \end{align*} $$ For the subgroups, if the order was 2 or 3, then we know they must be cyclic. In this case, we know all the subgroups of order 2 (all the flips) are cyclic unique subgroups. For orders 3 and 6, they could be cyclic but they could also fail to be cyclic. Take order 3, first we check if there are elements of order 3 in the group. Yes, we have \(r^3\) and \(r^6\). Why we look for those? Because by definition of the order of an element, they will each generate a subgroup of order 3 (Recall from the subgroups lecture \(|\langle g \rangle| = o(g)\)). In fact, here \(r^3\) and \(r^6\) both generate the same subgroup.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lecture 12: Homomorphism</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/04/math417-12-homomorphism.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lecture 12: Homomorphism" /><published>2025-02-04T00:01:36-08:00</published><updated>2025-02-04T00:01:36-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/04/math417-12-homomorphism</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2025/02/04/math417-12-homomorphism.html"><![CDATA[<p>While isomorphisms need to be bijections, Homomorphisms do not.</p>

<div class="mintbodydiv">

<h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p><b>Example 1</b>: Consider the following with the addition operation</p>

	$$
	\begin{align*}
	\pi \ : \ &amp;\mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n\\
	          &amp;a \rightarrow [a]_n
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>\(\pi\) is a homomorphism because \([a+b] = [a] + [b]\). Remember the rule is that \(\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\) where the first operation comes from the first group while the second operation comes from the second group. Here, both groups have addition as their binary operation. 
<br />
<br />
\(\pi\) is also surjective. Since for any element \(h \in \mathbf{Z}_n\), we have an element \(g \in \mathbf{Z}\) such that \(\pi(g) = [g]\). Moreover, we see that \(ker(\pi) = \mathbf{Z}n = \langle n \rangle\).
<br />
<br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<b>Example 2</b>: Suppose \(g \in G\). Let</p>

<p>We want to show that \(\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\). But we know that \(\varphi(ab) = g^{a+b} =  g^ag^b = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\). So \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism.

<h4><b>Normal Subgroups</b></h4>
<p>It turns out that only a certain kind of subgroups could be kernels of homomorphism.
<br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="mintheaderdiv">
Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
	A normal subgroup of \(G\) is a subgroup \(N \leq G\) such that \(gNg^{-1} = N\) for all \(g \in G\) where \(gNg^{-1} = \{gng^{-1} \ | \ n \in N\}\). 
</div>
<p><br />
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
This operation \(x \rightarrow gxg^{-1}\) is called the conjugation of \(x\) by \(g\). The definition says that if we conjeguate all the elements of \(N\) by a fixed element \(g \in G\), then we should get \(N\) back for every \(g\). 
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
To show a subgroup \(N \leq G\) is normal, it suffies to show that \(gNg^{-1} \subseteq N\) for all \(g \in G\).
</div>
<p><br />
That is, we just need to check that each \(gNg^{-1}\) is a subset of \(N\).
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<br />
<br />
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
Given that \(gNg^{-1} \subseteq N\). We want to show that this implies that \(N \subseteq gNg^{-1}\) which means that \(gNg^{-1} = N\) which is what is required by the definition.
<br />
<br />
Let \(g \in G\) and \(n \in N\). Observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	n &amp;= (gg^{-1})n(gg^{-1}) \\
	  &amp;= g(g^{-1}ng)g^{-1} \\
	  &amp;= g(x)g^{-1}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>where \(x = g^{-1}ng\). If we show that \(gNg^{-1} \subseteq N\), then we need to show that for any \(n \in N\), this \(n\) can be written as \(n = g^{-1}ng = x\) which means that we want to show that \(x \in N\). But by the hypothesis</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 x &amp;= g^{-1}ng \\
	   &amp;= g^{-1}n(g^{-1})^{-1} \\
	   &amp;= ana^{-1} \quad \text{ (let $a = g^{-1}$ where $g^{-1} \in G$)}
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Since \(g^{-1}\) is just an arbitrary element in \(G\), then \(ana^{-1} \in N\) which is what we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\)
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>Take \(D_3 = \{e, r, r^2, j, rj, r^2j\}\) where \(r^3 = e = j^2\) and \(jr = r^{-1}j\). This rule also implies \(jr^k = r^{-k}j\). Now suppose we have the subgroup generated by \(j\), \(H = \langle j \rangle = \{e, j\}\). Is this a normal subgroup?
<br />
<br />
For every \(g \in G\), we want to show that \(gHg^{-1} \subseteq H\) so</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 eHe^{-1} &amp;= H. \\
	 rHr^{-1} &amp;= \{rer^{-1}, rjr^{-1}\} = \{e, r^2j\} \neq H.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>So we stop here. This is not a normal subgroup. Does \(D_3\) have any normal subgroups? The trivial subgroups are normal subgroups. What about any non-trivial subgroups? It turns out that \(N = \langle r \rangle = \{e,r,r^2\}\) is normal in \(D_3\). We have to check all 6 cases</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 eNe^{-1} &amp;= N \\
	 rNr^{-1} &amp;= N \\
	 r^2Nr^{-2} &amp;= N \\
	 jNr^{-1} &amp;= N \\
	 rjN(rj)^{-1} &amp;= N \\
	 r^2jN(r^2j)^{-1} &amp;= N.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>FACT: If \(G\) has some generating set like \(G = \langle g_1, ..., g_r \rangle\), then to check if \(H\) is normal, we just need to show that \(g_kHg_k^{-1}\) for each \(g_i\) in the generating set \(g_1, ... g_k\). So for \(D_3\), we know it is generated by \(\langle r, j \rangle\), so we can check those two.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Kernels are Normal Subgroups</b></h4>
<p>Back to homomorphisms. It turns out that kernels of homomorphisms are normal subgroups.
<br /></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
If \(\varphi \ : \ G \rightarrow H\) is a homomorphism, then \(K = ker \varphi = \{g \in G \ | \ \varphi(g) = e\} \) is a normal subgroup.
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
We know that \(k\) is a subgroup of \(G\). We need to show that given \(g \in G\) and \(x \in K\) that \(gxg^{-1} \in K\). By definition, to check if any element is in the kernel, we need to apply the homomorphism and see if the result is the identity element. So</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \varphi(gNg^{-1}) &amp;= \varphi(g)\varphi(x)\varphi(g)^{-1} \\
					  &amp;= \varphi(g)e\varphi(g)^{-1} \\
					  &amp;= \varphi(g)\varphi(g)^{-1} \\
					  &amp;= e.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>From this, we see \(gKg^{-1} \subseteq K\) for all \(g \in G\). \(\blacksquare\)
<br />
<br />
Note also that all subgroups of abelian groups are normal.
<br />
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br />
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Injectivity of Homomorphisms</b></h4>
<p>Another useful fact:
<br /></p>
<div class="peachheaderdiv">
Proposition
</div>
<div class="peachbodydiv">
Let \(\varphi \ : \ G \rightarrow H\) be a homomorphism, then \(\varphi\) is injective if and only if \(K = ker(\varphi) = \{e\} \).
</div>
<p><br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<b>Proof</b>
<br />
\(\Longrightarrow\): Suppose that \(\varphi\) is injective. This means that if \(\varphi(a) = \varphi(e) = e\), then \(a = e\). But this means that the only element where \(\varphi(a) = e\) is the identity element itself. [why must \(varphi(e)=e\)? I can’t remember, verify].
<br />
<br />
\(\Longleftarrow\):Now suppose that \(K = ker(\varphi) = \{e\}\). We want to show that \(\varphi\) is injective. This means that for any elements \(a, b \in G\), if \(\varphi(a) = \varphi(b)\), then we must have \(a = b\). Let \(\varphi(a) = \varphi(b) = h \in H\). We want to show that \(a = b\). Observe that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	 \varphi(a^{-1}b) &amp;= \varphi(a)^{-1}\varphi(b) \\
					  &amp;= h^{-1}h \\
					  &amp;= e_H.
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Since \(\varphi(a^{-1}b) = e_H\), then this implies that \(a^{-1}b \in K\). But \(K\) has only a single element which is the identity. Then \(a^{-1}b = e\) which means that \(a = b\) as desired. \(\ \blacksquare\)

Definition 2.4.1 A map between groups \(\varphi : G \rightarrow H\) is called a homomorphism if it preserves group multiplication, \(\varphi(g_1)(g_2) = \varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2)\) for all \(g_1, g_2 \in G\). An endomorphism of \(G\) is a homomorphism \(\varphi: G \rightarrow G\). So Given a homomorphism, if we find that it’s a bijection, then it is an isomorphism. Some Facts about Homomorphisms Proposition 2.4.11 Let \(\varphi : G \rightarrow H\) and \(\psi : G \rightarrow H\) be homomorphisms of groups. \(\varphi(e_G) = e_H\) For each \(g \in G\), \(\varphi(g^{-1}) = (\varphi(g))^{-1}\) Proof (Book) For any \(g \in G\). $$ \begin{align*} \varphi(e_G)\varphi(g) &amp;= \varphi(e_Gg) \quad \text{(because $\varphi$ is a homomorphism)} \\ &amp;= \varphi(g) \end{align*} $$ So \(\varphi(e_G)\) is an identity element in \(H\) but by the uniqueness of the identity element, then \(\varphi(e_G) = e_H\). Similarly, for any \(\in G\), $$ \begin{align*} \varphi(g^{-1})\varphi(g) &amp;= \varphi(g^{-1}g) \quad \text{(because $\varphi$ is a homomorphism)} \\ &amp;= \varphi(e_G) \\ &amp; = e_H \end{align*} $$ And by the uniqueness of the inverse, \(\varphi(g^{-1}) = \varphi(g)^{-1}\). \(\ \blacksquare\) The Image of a Homomorphism Given a homomorphism \(\varphi\) between two groups \(G\) and \(H\), the image of \(\varphi\) which is a subset of \(H\) is also a subgroup. Proposition Given some homomorphism \(\varphi: G \rightarrow H\). The image of this function $$ \begin{align*} \varphi(G) = \{\varphi(g) \ : \ g \in G\} \end{align*} $$ is a subgroup of \(H\). Proof TODO The Kernel of a Homomorphism The kernel of a group is simply all the elements such that \(\varphi(g)=e\). Definition 2.4.14 Let \(\varphi: G \rightarrow H\) be a homomorphism of groups. The kernel of the homomorphism \(\varphi\), denoted \(ker(\varphi)\), is \(\varphi^{-1}(e_H) = \{g \in G \ : \ \varphi(g) = e_H\}\). In fact, The kernel of a group \(K = ker \ \varphi\) is a subgroup of \(G\). Proof We will show this by showing that the kernel satisfies the subgroup properties: We know by Proposition 2.4.11, that \(\varphi(e_G) = e_H\) so \(e_G \in K\). Closed under product: For any \(a,b \in K\), \(\varphi(a)\varphi(b) = e_He_H = e_H \in K\) Closed under inverses: For any \(a \in K\), \(\varphi(a^{-1}) = \varphi(a)^{-1} = e_H^{-1} = e_H\). Therefore,\(a^{-1} \in K\). \(\ \blacksquare\) Examples Example 1: Consider the following with the addition operation $$ \begin{align*} \pi \ : \ &amp;\mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n\\ &amp;a \rightarrow [a]_n \end{align*} $$ \(\pi\) is a homomorphism because \([a+b] = [a] + [b]\). Remember the rule is that \(\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\) where the first operation comes from the first group while the second operation comes from the second group. Here, both groups have addition as their binary operation. \(\pi\) is also surjective. Since for any element \(h \in \mathbf{Z}_n\), we have an element \(g \in \mathbf{Z}\) such that \(\pi(g) = [g]\). Moreover, we see that \(ker(\pi) = \mathbf{Z}n = \langle n \rangle\). Example 2: Suppose \(g \in G\). Let $$ \begin{align*} \varphi \ : \ &amp;\mathbf{Z} \rightarrow G\\ &amp;k \rightarrow g^k \end{align*} $$ We want to show that \(\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\). But we know that \(\varphi(ab) = g^{a+b} = g^ag^b = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\). So \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism. Note here that the image of \(\varphi\) is the subgroup generated by \(g\), \(\langle g \rangle\). What about the kernel of \(\varphi\)? $$ \begin{equation*} ker(\varphi) = \begin{cases} \{0\} \quad &amp;\text{if } o(g) = \infty \\ \mathbf{Z}d \quad \quad &amp;\text{if } o(g) = d \end{cases} \end{equation*} $$ Example 3: Consider the following $$ \begin{align*} \varphi \ : \ &amp;D_n \rightarrow S_n\\ &amp;V \rightarrow Sym(V) \end{align*} $$ where \(V\) is the vertices of the polygon. In fact \(\varphi(D_n)\) is isomorphic to \(D_n\) and it is a subgroup of \(S_n\). Example 4: Consider the following $$ \begin{align*} \varphi \ : \ &amp;S_n \rightarrow GL(\mathbf{R}^{x})\\ &amp;\sigma \rightarrow P_{\sigma} \end{align*} $$ where \(P_{\sigma}\) is the matrix associated with the permutation \(\sigma\). For example $$ \begin{align*} (1 \ 2 \ 3) \rightarrow \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \end{align*} $$ Example 5: Consider the following $$ \begin{align*} \psi \ : \ &amp;GL(\mathbf{R}^{x}) \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{x}\\ &amp;P \rightarrow \det(P) \end{align*} $$ This is another homomorphism. In fact, The composition of \(\psi \circ \varphi\) is a homomorphism. That is $$ \begin{align*} \psi \circ \varphi \ : \ &amp;S_n \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{x}\\ &amp;\sigma \rightarrow \det(P_{\sigma}) \end{align*} $$ is a homomorphism. Fact: The composition of two homomorphism is a homomorphism. Example 6: Consider \(V\) where \(V\) is a vector space. Now consider the group \((V, +)\) (throw the scalar multiplication away). This is an abelian group. Consider the linear map $$ \begin{align*} T \ : \ &amp;V \rightarrow W \end{align*} $$ This is a homomorphism (recall that linear maps need to also to preserve scalar multiplication). Furthermore, \(ker T = \{v \in V \ | \ T(v) = 0\}\) (observe that the kernel is also the nullspace of \(T\)). Normal Subgroups It turns out that only a certain kind of subgroups could be kernels of homomorphism. Definition A normal subgroup of \(G\) is a subgroup \(N \leq G\) such that \(gNg^{-1} = N\) for all \(g \in G\) where \(gNg^{-1} = \{gng^{-1} \ | \ n \in N\}\). This operation \(x \rightarrow gxg^{-1}\) is called the conjugation of \(x\) by \(g\). The definition says that if we conjeguate all the elements of \(N\) by a fixed element \(g \in G\), then we should get \(N\) back for every \(g\). Proposition To show a subgroup \(N \leq G\) is normal, it suffies to show that \(gNg^{-1} \subseteq N\) for all \(g \in G\). That is, we just need to check that each \(gNg^{-1}\) is a subset of \(N\). Proof Given that \(gNg^{-1} \subseteq N\). We want to show that this implies that \(N \subseteq gNg^{-1}\) which means that \(gNg^{-1} = N\) which is what is required by the definition. Let \(g \in G\) and \(n \in N\). Observe that $$ \begin{align*} n &amp;= (gg^{-1})n(gg^{-1}) \\ &amp;= g(g^{-1}ng)g^{-1} \\ &amp;= g(x)g^{-1} \end{align*} $$ where \(x = g^{-1}ng\). If we show that \(gNg^{-1} \subseteq N\), then we need to show that for any \(n \in N\), this \(n\) can be written as \(n = g^{-1}ng = x\) which means that we want to show that \(x \in N\). But by the hypothesis $$ \begin{align*} x &amp;= g^{-1}ng \\ &amp;= g^{-1}n(g^{-1})^{-1} \\ &amp;= ana^{-1} \quad \text{ (let $a = g^{-1}$ where $g^{-1} \in G$)} \end{align*} $$ Since \(g^{-1}\) is just an arbitrary element in \(G\), then \(ana^{-1} \in N\) which is what we wanted to show. \(\ \blacksquare\) Examples Take \(D_3 = \{e, r, r^2, j, rj, r^2j\}\) where \(r^3 = e = j^2\) and \(jr = r^{-1}j\).

This is not a normal subgroup. Does \(D_3\) have any normal subgroups? The trivial subgroups are normal subgroups. What about any non-trivial subgroups?

Definition
</div>
<div class="mintbodydiv">
The Dihedral group is the group of rotational symmetries of a regular n-gon in \(\mathbf{R}^3\). It is a subgroup of the special orthogonal matrices, \(SO(3)\).
</div>
<p><br />
Before discussing the Dihedral group, we will discuss the symmetries of the disk. Why? if you inscribe a regular polygon inside a circle, observe that the symmetries of the polygon are a subset of the symmetries of the circle/disk. So it’s helpful to start there.
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Symmetries of the Disk</b></h4>
<p>Let \(D \leq SO(3)\) be the rotational symmetries of the unit disk: \(\{(x,y,0) \ | \ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}\). There are two types of rotations in \(D\). A rotation \(g\) around the \(z-\)axis so the \(z-\)axis remains fixed and we’re spinning the disk around it. Here \(g(e_3) = e_3\). The other type is when we flip the disk so the \(z-\)axis is now reversed. Here \(g(e_3) = -e_3\).
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Rotations Around the \(z-\)axis</b></h4>
<p>A rotation around an arbitrary angle which is \(r_{\theta} = Rot_{e_3}(\theta)\). It is always a symmetry around the unit disk. Note here that \(r_0=e\) and if we rotate by more than \(2\pi\), then it’s a rotation we’ve seen before. So \(r_{\theta + 2\pi n} = r_{\theta}\) so we need to specify \(r_{\theta}\) where \(\theta \in [0, 2\pi)]\). Note also that \(r_{\theta}^{-1} = r_{-\theta}\).
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Rotations Around the a Line in the \(xy-\)axis (Flips)</b></h4>
<p>Here the \(z-\)axis will get reversed since we’re flipping the disk by \(180^{\circ}\) (so \(e_3\) will now be \(-e_3\) facing the opposite the direction). The rotation axis itself is parallel to the \(xy\) plane. And we write \(j_{\theta} = Rot_{u_{\theta}}(\pi)\). Just draw a disk and draw any line that goes through the center. This line will be the rotation axis that is fixed and we’re flipping over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec11/disk.png" width="40%" class="center" /></p>
<p>The rotation vector can written as</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	u_\theta = (\cos \theta)e_1 + (\sin \theta)e_2 + 0e_3
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>This vector spans a line \(l_{\theta} = \mathbf{R}u_{\theta}\). This line is in the \(xy\) plane that goes through the vector \(u\). Note here that adding another rotation of \(\pi\) will not change the line so \(j_{\theta + \pi n} = j_{\theta}\). However, the vector \(u_{\theta}\) though will face the other direction after adding \(\pi\) and so \(u_{\theta+\pi} = -u_{\theta}\). Moreover, \(j^2_{\theta} = e\).
<br />
<br />
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------></p>
<h4><b>Multiplication of Rotations and Flips</b></h4>
<p>To describe the group structure, we want to see what happens if we perform two rotations, two flips, a rotation followed by a flip and a flip followed by a rotation.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Two Rotations:</b> This case is easy, since two rotations around the \(z-\)axis (spinning around) is just another rotation so

<h4><b>Elements of \(D\)</b></h4>
<p>Based on the previous list, we can now list precisely the elements of (D). We have</p>

	<li>\(r_{\theta}\) for unique \(\theta \in [0, 2\pi)\). Noting that \(r_{\theta + 2\pi n} = r_{\theta}\)</li>

<h4><b>Dihedral Groups</b></h4>
<p>Fix \(n \geq 3\). Let \(V = \{u_{\frac{2\pi}{n}k}, k = 0,...,n-1\}\) be the vertices of a regular \(n-\)gon. Note that \(D_n \leq D \leq SO(3)\). Now, the group \(D_n\) will include specifically the symmetries of the disk that take the vertices of the polygon to themselves or another vertex in the polygon. In \(D_n\),</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	r_{\frac{2\pi}{n}} = r = Rot_{\frac{2\pi}{n}}(e_3)
	\end{align*}
	$$
</div>
<p>Rotations in \(D_n\) are therefore: \(e, r, r^2, r^3, ..., r^{n-1}\) where \(r^{k+n} = r^k\).<br />
Flips in \(D_n\) are \(j, rj, r^2,...,r^{n-1}j\) since we established that \(j_{\frac{\pi}{n}k} = r_{\frac{2\pi}{n}}j_0\). In general, we’ll have \(n\) flips for an \(n-\)polygon illustrated as follows</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/math/abstract-algebra/lec11/flips.png" width="70%" class="center" /></p>

<p>Note that \(D_n\) has \(2n\) symmetries total and we have the following identities:</p>
<ul>
	<li>\(r^n = e\)</li>
	<li>\(j^2 = e\)</li>
	<li>\(jr = r^{-1}j\)</li>
	<li>\(j^2 = e\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice also that this group is generated by two elements so \(D_n = \langle r, j\rangle\). Overall, you will see that</p>
<div>
	$$
	\begin{align*}
	D_3 &amp;= \{e, r, r^2, j, rj, r^2j\} \\
	D_4 &amp;= \{e, r, r^2, r^3, j, rj, r^2j, r^3j\}

It is a subgroup of the special orthogonal matrices, \(SO(3)\). Before discussing the Dihedral group, we will discuss the symmetries of the disk. Why? if you inscribe a regular polygon inside a circle, observe that the symmetries of the polygon are a subset of the symmetries of the circle/disk. So it’s helpful to start there. Symmetries of the Disk Let \(D \leq SO(3)\) be the rotational symmetries of the unit disk: \(\{(x,y,0) \ | \ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}\). There are two types of rotations in \(D\). A rotation \(g\) around the \(z-\)axis so the \(z-\)axis remains fixed and we’re spinning the disk around it. Here \(g(e_3) = e_3\). The other type is when we flip the disk so the \(z-\)axis is now reversed. Here \(g(e_3) = -e_3\). Rotations Around the \(z-\)axis A rotation around an arbitrary angle which is \(r_{\theta} = Rot_{e_3}(\theta)\). It is always a symmetry around the unit disk. Note here that \(r_0=e\) and if we rotate by more than \(2\pi\), then it’s a rotation we’ve seen before. So \(r_{\theta + 2\pi n} = r_{\theta}\) so we need to specify \(r_{\theta}\) where \(\theta \in [0, 2\pi)]\). Note also that \(r_{\theta}^{-1} = r_{-\theta}\). Rotations Around the a Line in the \(xy-\)axis (Flips) Here the \(z-\)axis will get reversed since we’re flipping the disk by \(180^{\circ}\) (so \(e_3\) will now be \(-e_3\) facing the opposite the direction). The rotation axis itself is parallel to the \(xy\) plane. And we write \(j_{\theta} = Rot_{u_{\theta}}(\pi)\). Just draw a disk and draw any line that goes through the center. This line will be the rotation axis that is fixed and we’re flipping over it. The rotation vector can written as $$ \begin{align*} u_\theta = (\cos \theta)e_1 + (\sin \theta)e_2 + 0e_3 \end{align*} $$ This vector spans a line \(l_{\theta} = \mathbf{R}u_{\theta}\). This line is in the \(xy\) plane that goes through the vector \(u\). Note here that adding another rotation of \(\pi\) will not change the line so \(j_{\theta + \pi n} = j_{\theta}\). However, the vector \(u_{\theta}\) though will face the other direction after adding \(\pi\) and so \(u_{\theta+\pi} = -u_{\theta}\). Moreover, \(j^2_{\theta} = e\). Multiplication of Rotations and Flips To describe the group structure, we want to see what happens if we perform two rotations, two flips, a rotation followed by a flip and a flip followed by a rotation. Two Rotations: This case is easy, since two rotations around the \(z-\)axis (spinning around) is just another rotation so $$ \begin{align*} r_{\alpha}r_{\beta} = r_{\alpha+\beta} \end{align*} $$ A Flip by \(\beta\) followed by a Rotation of \(\alpha\) \(r_{\alpha}j_{\beta}\): $$ \begin{align*} r_{\alpha}j_{\beta} = j_{\beta+\frac{\alpha}{2}} \end{align*} $$ But why? We first flip the disk where \(l_{\beta}\) is fixed like before. After the flip, we rotate the disk around the \(z-\)axis by \(\alpha\) as illustrated below So what we want is to compose these two operations into one and find where the fixed rotation axis will be. If you turn the third figure back to the front and now you want to use one flip to get to the same exact positions of the lines in the third figure, you'll see that the new axis will be \(u_{\beta+\frac{\alpha}{2}}\). A Rotation followed by a Flip \(j_{\alpha}r_{\beta}\): $$ \begin{align*} j_{\alpha}r_{\beta} = j_{\alpha-\frac{\beta}{2}} \end{align*} $$ Two Flips \(j_{\alpha}j_{\beta}\). Now this is clearly a rotation since we're back to the same face. but we're flipping by a different axis each time. The final rotation is the difference of the two times two. (TODO: why times 2?) $$ \begin{align*} j_{\alpha}j_{\beta} = r_{2(\alpha-\beta)} \end{align*} $$ Elements of \(D\) Based on the previous list, we can now list precisely the elements of (D). We have \(r_{\theta}\) for unique \(\theta \in [0, 2\pi)\). Noting that \(r_{\theta + 2\pi n} = r_{\theta}\) \(j_{\theta}\) for unique \(\theta \in [0, \pi)\). Noting that \(j_{\theta + \pi n} = j_{\theta}\) In addition to the multiplication table based on the previous discussion. \(r_{\alpha}r_{\beta} = r_{\alpha+\beta}\) \(r_{\alpha}j_{\beta} = j_{\beta+\frac{\alpha}{2}}\) \(j_{\alpha}r_{\beta} = j_{\alpha-\frac{\beta}{2}}\) \(j_{\alpha}j_{\beta} = r_{2(\alpha-\beta)}\) Alternative Description of \(D\) Another description is that let \(j = j_{0}\). Then, \(j_{\theta} = r_{2\theta}j\). So every element of \(D\) can be written uniquely in one of the following two forms. \(r_{\theta}, \theta \in [0, 2\pi]\) \(r_{\theta}j, \theta \in [0, 2\pi]\) where \(r_{\theta + 2\pi n} = r_{\theta}\) \(r_{\alpha}r_{\beta} = r_{\alpha+\beta}\) \(r_{\alpha + \beta}\) \(j^2 = e\) \(jr_{\theta} = r_{\theta}^{-1}j\). (TODO: Show this using the previous rules) This is a complete description of \(D\). Dihedral Groups Fix \(n \geq 3\). Let \(V = \{u_{\frac{2\pi}{n}k}, k = 0,...,n-1\}\) be the vertices of a regular \(n-\)gon. Note that \(D_n \leq D \leq SO(3)\). Now, the group \(D_n\) will include specifically the symmetries of the disk that take the vertices of the polygon to themselves or another vertex in the polygon. In \(D_n\), $$ \begin{align*} r_{\frac{2\pi}{n}} = r = Rot_{\frac{2\pi}{n}}(e_3) \end{align*} $$ Rotations in \(D_n\) are therefore: \(e, r, r^2, r^3, ..., r^{n-1}\) where \(r^{k+n} = r^k\). Flips in \(D_n\) are \(j, rj, r^2,...,r^{n-1}j\) since we established that \(j_{\frac{\pi}{n}k} = r_{\frac{2\pi}{n}}j_0\). In general, we’ll have \(n\) flips for an \(n-\)polygon illustrated as follows]]></summary></entry></feed>
